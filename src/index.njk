        I'm here for the shops and trades that keep neighborhoods alive. Corporate systems taught me how to make
        tools line up, data stay honest, and hours come back to your week. Now that efficiency is aimed at
        protecting independent businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're tired of wrestling vendors and software while giants squeeze margins, I'm on your side. We
        connect your tools, automate the busywork, and make sure the numbers agree. You get time, money, and
        momentum back.

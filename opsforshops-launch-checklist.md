Cadence Discussion Notes

The 3-2-1 split is a starting point. Here\'s the reasoning and what
might shift it:

-   **3 Person posts:** This is heavy on identity because you\'re
    building a brand from scratch. People follow people, not services.
    Once you\'re established, this could drop to 2.

-   **2 Real Problems:** This proves you understand the work. As you get
    clients and case studies, these become more powerful. Could increase
    to 3 once you have real examples to draw from.

-   **1 Invite:** Once a week keeps it from feeling salesy. The invite
    can vary in intensity --- sometimes it\'s \"here\'s who I work
    with,\" sometimes it\'s just \"what\'s your biggest ops headache
    right now?\" Keeping it to 1 means every other post is giving, not
    asking.

-   **Platform adaptation:** LinkedIn gets the long-form. X gets the
    punchy distillation. Bluesky gets the most candid/philosophical
    version. Same idea, three expressions.

+---+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
|   | **DECISIONS NEEDED**                       |                      |
+---+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| ☐ | **6 posts/week sustainable?**              | *Capacity*           |
|   |                                            |                      |
|   | Consider batching --- write a week\'s      |                      |
|   | content in one session. Or start at 4-5    |                      |
|   | and scale up.                              |                      |
+---+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| ☐ | **Cross-posting strategy**                 | *Efficiency*         |
|   |                                            |                      |
|   | Same content adapted per platform, or      |                      |
|   | unique content per platform? Adapted is    |                      |
|   | more sustainable.                          |                      |
+---+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| ☐ | **Personal brand vs. business brand**      | *Identity*           |
|   |                                            |                      |
|   | Are you posting as Braedon or as Ops for   |                      |
|   | Shops? Recommendation: Braedon. People buy |                      |
|   | from people.                               |                      |
+---+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| ☐ | **Engagement time budget**                 | *Time*               |
|   |                                            |                      |
|   | Posting without engaging is shouting into  |                      |
|   | void. Budget 20-30 min/day for replies and |                      |
|   | comments.                                  |                      |
+---+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| ☐ | **Metric for success at 30 days**          | *Measurement*        |
|   |                                            |                      |
|   | What tells you this is working? Discovery  |                      |
|   | calls booked? DMs received? Define it now. |                      |
+---+--------------------------------------------+----------------------+
| ☐ | **Week 4+ cadence adjustment trigger**     | *Iteration*          |
|   |                                            |                      |
|   | When do you reassess the 3-2-1 mix?        |                      |
|   | Suggest: after 4 weeks of data on          |                      |
|   | engagement.                                |                      |

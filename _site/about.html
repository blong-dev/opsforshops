        The middle class doesn't exist without small business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two of my favorite neighborhood shops shut down in the last month and I'm crushed. My pharmacy is gone. I've never had a good pharmacist before this one. Genuine advice, caring people... it was more than a transaction. I supported them with my business, but the slow crush of insurance and rising costs just made it too much for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've watched from inside the corporate world as giant companies slowly squeeze the life out of middle America. I don't know about you, but I'm sick of spending money on mega corps that rely on tax subsidies and welfare to crush the businesses that gave this country life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm tired of standing by and watching what's left of my culture die.
      </p>
      <p>
        For years I've wanted to start my own business, and now I'm all in.
      </p>
      <p>
        I help local businesses with vendors and technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm an Enterprise Architect. Basically, I've built a career making software and vendor decisions for mid-large companies. I came from data - analytics, engineering, architecture - you name it I do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know, I mean I fucking know, that if I can just help a little, lift a little bit of the burden of technology from the shoulders of my heroes, not hyperbole, small business owners are local fucking heroes, then I know I can make their lives easier and they might be able to fight another day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Big government caved in to monopolies 60 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have to fight for our lives, help isn't coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel like everywhere I look there are people selling shit to SBO's who are overworked, over stressed, and stretched thin. I'm faced right now with this double edged sword, I gotta find people to serve but I don't want to sound like the flood of bull shit.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the problem I see that I can help with.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do Vendor Reviews, I automate data entry, I make software talk to each other. I do it right and I'll own it for you for a good rate, so you never have to worry about it again.
      </p>
      <p>
        That means your numbers will match, you'll know where your money comes from and where it goes, and tax season will be easier than ever before. And you don't have to work all night to make it happen. I want to save you time and money.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you know people, or if you are that person, reach out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much love,
      </p>
      <p>

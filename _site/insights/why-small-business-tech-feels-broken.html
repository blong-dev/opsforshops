    <h1 id="article-title">Why Small Business Tech Feels Broken</h1>
    <p class="lead">If you run a small business, you already know this feeling.</p>

    <article class="flow article-body">
      <p>Your POS says one thing. Your accounting software says another. Your website is out of date. Google doesn't show what you actually sell.</p>
<p>At some point you just assume this is normal. That this is the cost of doing business. That nothing ever really lines up, and the only way forward is to work later, check harder, and hope tax season isn't a nightmare.</p>
<p>That assumption is wrong.</p>
<p>Most small businesses are running on software that was never set up to work together. Not because the owner screwed it up. Not because they're bad with technology. But because that's how this entire ecosystem is built.</p>
<p>You don't buy "a system." You buy pieces. A POS when you need to take payments. A website when you need to look legitimate. Accounting software because you have to. Maybe a CRM later, when following up with customers starts falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>Each decision makes sense on its own. None of them are made with the full picture in mind.</p>
<p>The POS runs transactions. The website is just out there. The books track money after the fact. Customer information is scattered wherever it happens to land.</p>
<p>No one is responsible for making sure these tools share accurate information with each other. The vendors don't do it. The government doesn't care. And the business owner sure as hell doesn't have the time.</p>
<p>So they don't talk.</p>
<p>And when systems don't talk cleanly, the damage isn't dramatic. It's quiet. Numbers have to be checked instead of trusted. Inventory has to be updated manually. Sales data shows up late, incomplete, or slightly off. Simple questions take way longer than they should to answer.</p>
<p>Nothing is catastrophically broken. Everything is just slightly wrong, all the time.</p>
<p>That's the part people don't talk about. That constant, low-grade friction that drains energy day after day. Not enough to stop you, but enough to wear you down.</p>
<p>This isn't caused by bad decisions. It's caused by normal ones, made under pressure, with limited time, and bad options. Most vendors assume you'll deal with the gaps later. Later turns into nights. Weekends. One more spreadsheet. One more manual check before you feel comfortable hitting "send."</p>
<p>Eventually, instead of running a business, you're managing software.</p>
<p>That's not a personal failure. That's a setup problem.</p>
<p>And it's not fixed by chasing the next shiny tool or ripping everything out and starting over. That usually makes things worse. The real work is slower and less flashy. It's understanding where information actually originates, where it gets duplicated, and where it breaks down. Once you can see that clearly, the chaos stops feeling inevitable.</p>
<p>This isn't about "digital transformation" or "modernizing your stack." It's about giving business owners something they almost never get: numbers they can trust and systems that don't fight them every step of the way.</p>
<p>You shouldn't have to be a technologist to keep your business upright. And you shouldn't have to work all night just to make your tools agree with each other.</p>
<p>If this feels familiar, you're not broken. The setup is.</p>
<p>The important thing to understand is that this situation is not permanent, and it doesn't require starting over. Most businesses don't need new tools — they need clarity about how their existing ones are actually behaving. Once that's visible, the pressure drops quickly.</p>
<p>What most owners actually want isn't better software. It's quieter days. Fewer surprises. Systems that don't demand attention. That's possible — but only once you stop assuming the friction is normal.</p>
<p>If this speaks to you, reach out. I'll roll up my sleeves and share my expertise.</p>

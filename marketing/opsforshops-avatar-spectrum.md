**OPS FOR SHOPS**

Avatar Spectrum

*Who we\'re talking to --- and how they hear us*

February 2026

These three avatars represent the spectrum of people who feel
operational pain in small-to-mid organizations. They share the same core
frustration --- systems that don\'t work, time being wasted, potential
going unrealized --- but they come at it from different positions, with
different authority, different fears, and different buying behaviors.

The lander speaks to what they share. The campaign content speaks to
where they differ.

1\. The Backbone

**The Office Manager / Practice Admin**

*The person holding everything together with duct tape and
determination*

**WHO SHE IS**

**Age:** 28--45

**Gender:** Predominantly women

**Title:** Office Manager, Practice Administrator, Operations
Coordinator

**Industry:** Law firms, accounting practices, real estate offices,
medical practices, non-profits

**Org size:** 5--30 people

**Reports to:** Managing partner, executive director, or owner

**Tech comfort:** Intermediate --- she can learn any tool, but doesn\'t
have time to evaluate or implement them properly

**WHAT HER DAY LOOKS LIKE**

She arrives before everyone else and leaves after most of them. Her
morning starts with putting out fires --- a report that didn\'t pull
correctly, a vendor invoice that doesn\'t match, a staff question about
how to use software nobody was trained on. She\'s the person everyone
asks when something doesn\'t work. She manages onboarding, billing,
scheduling, vendor relationships, sometimes HR, sometimes marketing. Her
actual job description stopped being accurate two years ago. She has a
running mental list of twenty things that should be automated but
aren\'t, and she adds to it weekly.

**WHAT SHE\'S FEELING**

Competent but underwater. She knows she\'s good at her job --- the
office would collapse without her and everyone knows it. But she\'s
frustrated because she spends most of her time on tasks that shouldn\'t
require a human. She feels like she\'s being wasted. There\'s a version
of her role where she\'s actually strategic, actually improving things,
but she can\'t get there because she\'s too busy keeping the lights on.
She\'s not burned out yet, but she can see it from here.

**THINGS SHE\'S THINKING BUT MIGHT NOT SAY**

> *\"I spend half my week doing things a computer should do.\"*
>
> *\"I\'ve told them three times we need to fix this system and nothing
> changes.\"*
>
> *\"If I could just get on top of everything, I could actually make
> this place run.\"*
>
> *\"I don\'t even know what to Google to solve this.\"*
>
> *\"I\'m scared to bring in someone who\'ll make things worse or waste
> our money.\"*
>
> *\"If I fix this, I deserve a raise. But I need help to fix it.\"*

**WHAT TRIGGERS HER TO LOOK FOR HELP**

A breaking point moment. The old system finally fails during a critical
period (tax season, a big case, audit time). A vendor forces a migration
and nobody knows how to handle it. She gets asked to produce a report
and realizes the data is a mess. Or she simply hits a wall where the
manual workaround she\'s been holding together stops scaling. She starts
searching --- not for a consultant, but for a solution. She might Google
\'how to connect QuickBooks to our CRM\' before she ever thinks to hire
someone.

**WHAT SHE NEEDS TO HEAR FROM YOU**

You\'re not crazy, this shouldn\'t be this hard. I\'ve seen this exact
situation dozens of times and here\'s what we can do about it. I\'m not
going to come in and make your life harder --- I\'m going to make you
look like a genius. You\'ll understand everything I build, and you\'ll
own it. This is your win.

**HOW SHE BUYS**

**Decision authority:** She influences heavily but usually needs
sign-off from the owner or managing partner. In smaller orgs (under 10),
she may have direct budget authority for operational expenses.

**Budget reality:** She doesn\'t control a large budget, but she can
justify operational expenses that save time or reduce errors. She\'s
more comfortable with a defined project cost than an open-ended
retainer. The Tune-Up price point is her entry --- she can justify that
without a long internal conversation.

**Sales cycle:** Short if she has authority (days to a week). Longer if
she needs to sell it internally (2-4 weeks). She\'ll need something to
show her boss --- a clear scope, a clear outcome, a clear price.

**What closes her:** Specificity. She doesn\'t want to hear \'we\'ll
assess your needs.\' She wants to hear \'in 90 minutes we\'ll map your
systems, find the three biggest time sinks, and give you a plan with
costs.\' She wants to know exactly what she\'s getting.

**LIKELY OBJECTIONS**

• We\'ve tried bringing in tech people before and it was a mess.

• I don\'t have time to manage another project on top of everything
else.

• My boss won\'t go for it --- they don\'t see the problem because I\'m
holding it together.

• What if we pay for this and nothing actually changes?

• I don\'t want to learn a whole new system.

**WHERE TO FIND HER**

LinkedIn (she follows productivity and office management content). Local
business networking events. Referrals from other office managers ---
they talk to each other. Facebook groups for practice administrators.
She\'s also the person who answers the phone when you cold call the
office, which is worth remembering.

2\. The Reluctant Operator

**The Owner Wearing the Ops Hat**

*The expert who started a business and accidentally became an IT
department*

**WHO SHE IS**

**Age:** 35--60

**Gender:** Mixed, skews male in traditional professional services

**Title:** Owner, Founder, Managing Partner, Executive Director

**Industry:** Same spread --- but especially solo practices, small
firms, and non-profits

**Org size:** 1--15 people

**Reports to:** Nobody (that\'s part of the problem)

**Tech comfort:** Low to intermediate --- competent in their domain,
often behind on operational technology

**WHAT HER DAY LOOKS LIKE**

He started this business to do the work he\'s good at --- law,
accounting, therapy, whatever the craft is. Instead he spends 30-40% of
his time on operations, technology, and admin because the business
isn\'t big enough to fully delegate it and he doesn\'t trust anyone else
to get it right. He\'s the bottleneck and he knows it. He bought
software he doesn\'t fully use. He has subscriptions he forgot about.
His \'system\' is a combination of spreadsheets, email chains, and
institutional knowledge that lives only in his head. He\'s successful
enough to be busy but not organized enough to scale.

**WHAT SHE\'S FEELING**

Quietly overwhelmed but won\'t say it. He started this business for
autonomy and instead got a different kind of trap. He\'s proud of what
he\'s built but frustrated that the operational side is always the thing
that drags. He\'s suspicious of consultants because he\'s been burned
--- someone came in, used a lot of jargon, charged a lot, and nothing
really changed. He respects competence and directness. He doesn\'t want
a pitch, he wants a conversation with someone who gets it.

**THINGS SHE\'S THINKING BUT MIGHT NOT SAY**

> *\"I didn\'t start this business to fight with software.\"*
>
> *\"I know I\'m leaving money on the table but I don\'t know where.\"*
>
> *\"Every consultant I\'ve talked to wants to sell me something I
> don\'t need.\"*
>
> *\"I just need someone who can come in and make this stuff work.\"*
>
> *\"I don\'t have time to explain my whole business to someone who
> won\'t understand it.\"*
>
> *\"If I could get the operations right, I could actually grow.\"*

**WHAT TRIGGERS HER TO LOOK FOR HELP**

A growth opportunity he can\'t capture because his operations can\'t
support it. A painful tax season where the books were a disaster. Losing
a client or employee because of something that should have been
systematized. A conversation with a peer who has their operations dialed
in. Or simply a moment of clarity where he realizes he\'s paying himself
a premium hourly rate to do \$20/hour admin work.

**WHAT SHE NEEDS TO HEAR FROM YOU**

I\'m not here to sell you a platform or a transformation. I\'m here to
look at what you\'ve got, find the things that are costing you the most
time and money, and fix them. You\'ll understand everything. Nothing
changes without your say-so. I\'ve done this for companies fifty times
your size --- I\'m choosing to do it for businesses like yours because
it matters.

**HOW SHE BUYS**

**Decision authority:** He is the decision maker. Full stop.

**Budget reality:** He can spend money but he\'s protective of it. He\'s
not cheap --- he\'s been burned. He needs to see clear ROI. The Tune-Up
is perfect for him because it\'s low-risk: small dollar amount, clear
deliverable, no commitment beyond 90 minutes. If the Tune-Up impresses
him, the Automation Build is an easy yes.

**Sales cycle:** Can be very fast (same week) if he trusts you. He
decides with his gut as much as his spreadsheet. A personal referral or
a strong first conversation can close him immediately.

**What closes her:** Trust and directness. He wants to feel like he\'s
talking to a peer, not a vendor. No jargon. No upsell. Show him you
understand his world in the first five minutes and he\'s yours.

**LIKELY OBJECTIONS**

• I\'ve been burned by consultants before.

• I don\'t have time for a big project right now.

• My systems work fine --- they\'re just not pretty. (They\'re not
fine.)

• How do I know this won\'t just be another subscription I don\'t use?

• Can\'t I just hire someone part-time to handle this?

**WHERE TO FIND HER**

Chamber of Commerce events. Rotary. Industry-specific networking (Bar
Association, accounting society meetings). Referrals from his peers ---
he trusts word of mouth more than anything online. LinkedIn if he uses
it, but he\'s more of a lurker than a poster. He\'s the person you meet
at a local event and have a ten-minute conversation with that turns into
a client relationship.

3\. The Mid-Migration Marketer

**The Marketing Person Leading a Tech Transition**

*The capable professional who just hit the edge of her expertise*

**WHO SHE IS**

**Age:** 25--40

**Gender:** Mixed, slight female skew

**Title:** Marketing Coordinator, Marketing Manager, Communications
Director, Digital Manager

**Industry:** Any small-to-mid org going through a tech transition

**Org size:** 5--30 people

**Reports to:** Owner, executive director, or department head

**Tech comfort:** High for marketing tools, moderate-to-low for
operational/backend systems

**WHAT HER DAY LOOKS LIKE**

She\'s in the middle of a vendor switch --- maybe moving CRMs, changing
email platforms, migrating a website, or consolidating marketing tools.
She was given this project because she\'s \'the tech-savvy one\' even
though the migration involves systems way outside her expertise
(billing, data, integrations). She\'s learning on the fly, making
decisions she\'s not fully qualified to make, and terrified of breaking
something. She\'s also still expected to do her actual job --- the
campaigns, the content, the social media --- while managing a migration
that should be a full-time project.

**WHAT SHE\'S FEELING**

In over her head but determined not to show it. She took on this project
partly because it was an opportunity to prove herself, but it\'s become
bigger than she expected. She\'s spending nights reading documentation
and watching tutorials. She\'s worried about data loss, about choosing
the wrong platform, about the transition disrupting the business. She
needs an expert but she\'s afraid that hiring one means admitting she
couldn\'t handle it --- which isn\'t true, the project just outgrew its
original scope.

**THINGS SHE\'S THINKING BUT MIGHT NOT SAY**

> *\"This was supposed to be a simple switch and now it\'s touching
> everything.\"*
>
> *\"I don\'t know enough about the billing side to make this decision
> safely.\"*
>
> *\"If I mess up this migration, it\'s on me.\"*
>
> *\"I need someone who can just tell me: here\'s what you do, here\'s
> the order, here\'s what not to touch.\"*
>
> *\"I don\'t need someone to take over --- I need someone to make sure
> I don\'t break anything.\"*
>
> *\"This would be so much easier if someone could just look at our
> setup and tell me what connects to what.\"*

**WHAT TRIGGERS HER TO LOOK FOR HELP**

The migration hits a wall. Data doesn\'t transfer cleanly. She discovers
that the new tool doesn\'t integrate with an existing system nobody told
her about. A deadline is approaching and she realizes she\'s going to
miss it. Or she\'s at the decision point --- about to commit to a vendor
or a migration plan --- and she wants someone to sanity-check it before
she pulls the trigger.

**WHAT SHE NEEDS TO HEAR FROM YOU**

This isn\'t a you problem --- this project is genuinely complex and you
were smart to recognize you need support. I\'m not going to take this
away from you. I\'m going to work alongside you, make sure the technical
pieces connect properly, and make sure nothing breaks. You\'ll
understand every decision we make. When this is done, you\'ll own it and
you\'ll know how it works.

**HOW SHE BUYS**

**Decision authority:** She usually has project-level budget authority
or can get approval quickly because the migration is already an approved
initiative. The money is already being spent --- she\'s redirecting it
toward expertise rather than asking for new budget.

**Budget reality:** Moderate. The org has already committed to spending
on the transition. Bringing in help is an incremental cost against an
existing project, which is an easier sell than a net-new expense. She\'s
most likely to buy a scoped engagement --- \'help me with the
migration\' --- rather than an ongoing relationship. But if you do good
work, she becomes an internal champion for future projects.

**Sales cycle:** Fast. She\'s in active pain. If you can demonstrate
quickly that you understand her situation and can help without
condescending to her, she\'ll move in days. She\'s not comparison
shopping --- she\'s looking for someone who makes her feel like the
project is going to be okay.

**What closes her:** Competence without condescension. She\'s smart and
capable --- she just hit the limits of her domain expertise. If you
treat her like she\'s in over her head, you\'ll lose her. If you treat
her like a peer who happens to need a specialist, you\'ll win her
loyalty. Show her the plan, show her you\'ve done this before, and let
her stay in the driver\'s seat.

**LIKELY OBJECTIONS**

• I should be able to figure this out myself.

• My boss might think I\'m not capable if I bring in outside help.

• We already have a budget for the new software --- I\'m not sure
there\'s room for consulting too.

• I just need someone for this one project, I don\'t need an ongoing
thing.

• What if the person I hire doesn\'t understand our specific tools?

**WHERE TO FIND HER**

LinkedIn (she\'s active --- posting about marketing, sharing articles,
engaging with content). Marketing-specific communities and Slack groups.
She\'s also likely searching for very specific things: \'how to migrate
from Mailchimp to HubSpot\' or \'CRM data migration checklist.\' Content
that addresses those specific moments will reach her. She may also find
you through the office manager or owner at her own org.

4\. The Thread That Connects Them

Despite different titles, ages, and authority levels, these three people
share a core experience.

**THE SHARED PAIN**

They are all stuck between knowing things could be better and not having
the technical expertise, time, or authority to make it happen alone.
They are competent people being failed by their systems, not the other
way around.

**THE SHARED EMOTIONAL NEED**

They don\'t want to be sold to. They don\'t want jargon. They don\'t
want to feel stupid. They want someone who sees their situation clearly,
speaks plainly, and makes them feel like the problem is solvable --- and
that solving it is their victory, not yours.

**THE SHARED LANGUAGE**

Your messaging should use their words, not industry terminology. They
say \'our systems don\'t talk to each other,\' not \'we need an
integration architecture review.\' They say \'I\'m spending all my time
on stuff that should be automatic,\' not \'we need workflow
automation.\' They say \'I just need someone who gets it,\' not \'we\'re
seeking a strategic technology partner.\'

**THE UNIVERSAL MESSAGE**

Your systems should work for you, not the other way around. I\'ll show
you exactly what\'s costing you time and money, fix the things that
matter most, and make sure you understand everything. No jargon, no
lock-in, no mystery.

**HOW THIS SHAPES THE LANDER**

The homepage speaks to the person, not the firm. It leads with the
feeling (\'You know there\'s a better way\'), establishes credibility
through plainspokenness rather than credentials, and offers a
low-barrier first step (the Tune-Up). Industry-specific proof lives in
the campaign content and case studies, not the lander itself. The lander
is the empathy layer. The content is the expertise layer.

## PROSPECT 1: Ryan's All-Glass
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Ryan's All-Glass Co.
- **Website:** https://ryansallglass.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 771-4440 (main); (513) 401-8910 (alternate)
- **Email:** info@ryansallglass.com (confirmed from website contact page)
- **Location (HQ):** 9884 Springfield Pike, Cincinnati, OH 45215
- **Additional Location:** 9401 Le Saint Dr, Fairfield, OH 45014
- **Closed Location:** 7207 Beechmont Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45230 (auto glass location, now closed per Yelp)
- **Founded:** 1982 (44 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~26 (ZoomInfo); other sources range 11-50 (ZoomInfo), 51-200 (LinkedIn). Most credible estimate: 26-40 employees across divisions.
- **Revenue:** ~$13-13.5M annually (ZoomInfo estimates)
- **Service Area:** Cincinnati, Dayton, Northern Kentucky -- full tri-state coverage
- **Services:** Auto glass repair/replacement, residential glass (shower enclosures, mirrors, fogged glass, tabletops, custom glass cutting), commercial glass (storefronts, curtain walls, security glass, railings, conference rooms, energy-efficient glazing)

### Key People
- **Bruce Ryan** -- President & Founder. Cincinnati native, founded Ryan's All-Glass in 1982. Built the company from the ground up over 40+ years.
- **Dan Ryan** -- Owner / Commercial Vice President. 2nd generation. Cincinnati native raising a family in the area. Took over ownership from his father Bruce. (Source: ryansallglass.com/about-us/, LinkedIn, RocketReach)
- **Jeff Grupenhof** -- General Manager. (Source: ZoomInfo employee directory)
- **George Lantz** -- Vice President, Estimator & Project Manager. (Source: ZoomInfo/RocketReach employee directory)
- **Herb South** -- Project Manager. (Source: Datanyze contact listing)
- **No Office Manager or Operations Manager publicly identified** -- significant signal. With 5 area locations (now consolidated), multiple divisions (auto, residential, commercial), and 26+ employees, the absence of a visible ops/admin leader suggests the owner or GM is handling dispatch, scheduling, and back-office coordination directly.

### Email Pattern
- Generic: info@ryansallglass.com (confirmed from website)
- Likely pattern: firstname@ryansallglass.com or first.last@ryansallglass.com (inferred from industry norms)
- Call to verify before sending cold email

### Pain Signals

**Severe Scheduling & Dispatch Breakdowns (Multiple Customer Reports):**
- A customer reported "an extremely frustrating time with scheduling and rescheduling and measuring 3 times." (Source: Yelp)
- Another customer reported working with them "for over 6 months trying to get shower doors installed" and that they "came to the house, had the wrong measurement, and 're-cut' the glass SIX times." (Source: Angi / Yelp reviews)
- A third stated: "the project would be done around 6 weeks and it took well over 3 months to get the shower door installed" and **"they never called with updates and when I would call was treated rudely."** (Source: Yelp review)
- Another reviewer: "we asked them to come out to measure our opening, 3 weeks later they showed up" and then "they said they would return early the next week, but when we called to see when, they said, glass was not even in stock until Wednesday." Same reviewer: **"They called Thursday morning to tell us they would come between 3-5. We leave work to be there by 3, but they showed at 2."** (Source: Yelp review)
- Pattern: These reviews describe classic dispatch coordination failures -- wrong measurements repeated, no proactive customer communication, arrival windows not honored, and no system to track job status across the pipeline.

**Location Consolidation / Contraction Signal:**
- Ryan's formerly operated 5 locations across the tri-state area. The Beechmont Ave auto glass location is now listed as CLOSED on Yelp (as of December 2025). Consolidating locations while maintaining service area coverage requires tighter dispatch and routing -- precisely the kind of operational challenge that breaks down without proper software.

**Multi-Division Complexity:**
- Ryan's operates THREE distinct service lines: auto glass, residential glass, and commercial glass/glazing. Each has different workflows, pricing models, lead times, and crew requirements. Coordinating all three out of what appears to be a single dispatch function (with no visible operations manager) is a formula for the exact scheduling chaos their reviews describe.

**Generational Transition:**
- Bruce Ryan (founder, President) is still involved, but Dan Ryan (2nd generation) has taken over ownership. Generational transitions often create tension between "the way we've always done it" and the need for systems and process. Dan may be the champion for modernization but lacks the operational infrastructure to execute.

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website appears to be a modern custom-built or WordPress site (responsive design, professional photography, contact forms)
- Listed on Procore network (construction management platform) -- indicates their commercial division works with general contractors who use Procore, but this does not mean Ryan's uses Procore internally
- Contact is phone or web form only -- no online scheduling, no customer portal, no real-time job tracking visible
- No mention of any FSM, CRM, or dispatch software anywhere on their web presence
- Instagram active (@ryansallglass) -- marketing effort exists but operational tech does not appear to match

### Why They're a Top Prospect
Ryan's All-Glass is the strongest prospect in this list. They are a 44-year-old, 2nd-generation family business with ~$13.5M in revenue, ~26-40 employees, and three distinct service divisions (auto, residential, commercial) -- but their customer reviews paint a picture of chronic scheduling failures, missed appointments, and zero proactive communication. They recently closed at least one location, suggesting consolidation pressure. The generational transition from Bruce to Dan creates a natural inflection point where "we need to get organized" conversations happen. There is no visible operations manager, no dispatch software, and no customer portal. Dan Ryan is likely a Reluctant Operator who inherited a strong brand but needs systems to match the company's scale.

## PROSPECT 2: Frank's Glass, Inc.
**Priority: 2-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Frank's Glass, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.franksglass.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 829-8284 (main shop); (513) 275-5990 (mobile/appointment line); (513) 398-1366 (alternate)
- **Email:** dan@franksglass.com (Dan Brinkmann contact, per search results); generic contact via website form
- **Location:** 5191 Dixie Highway, Fairfield, OH 45014
- **Founded:** 1970 (56 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~11 (ZoomInfo/Wiza); other sources say 11-50 range. Historically grew to "over 20 employees" per company history page, current headcount appears ~11-15.
- **Revenue:** ~$6.1M annually (ZoomInfo estimate)
- **Service Area:** Cincinnati tri-state area (OH/KY/IN)
- **Services:** Auto glass (windshield, door glass, back glass, chip repair, side mirrors), residential glass (insulated window panes, shower enclosures, glass tabletops, vanity mirrors, residential entry doors), commercial glass (entry doors, curtain walls, window installations, storefronts)
- **Hours:** Monday-Friday 7:30 AM - 5:00 PM; Closed Saturday, Sunday & Holidays

### Key People
- **Dan Brinkmann** -- Owner / President. Took over the glass division from father Frank Brinkmann in 1994 when Frank retired. Runs the day-to-day glass business. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/dan-brinkmann-472a2412/ (Source: LinkedIn, RocketReach, franksglass.com history page)
- **David Brinkmann** -- Brother of Dan. Owns Frank's Auto Body (separate business, same family). Took over the auto body side when Frank Sr. retired. (Source: franksglass.com/about/franks-glass-history/)
- **Nathan Brinkmann** -- Commercial Manager. Likely Dan's son or nephew -- 3rd generation Brinkmann in the business. (Source: RocketReach management team listing)
- **Sandy Kuznof** -- Marketing Director. (Source: RocketReach management team listing)
- **Cody Franks** -- Owner and President (listed on some sources; may be an error or secondary stakeholder). (Source: RocketReach -- verify before use)

### Email Pattern
- Dan Brinkmann: dan@franksglass.com (inferred from RocketReach listing showing d***@franksglass.com pattern)
- Generic contact via website form at franksglass.com/contact/
- Call to verify before sending cold email

### Pain Signals

**Service Timeliness & Warranty Issues:**
- A customer reported the repair technician "showed up 90 minutes late" on the first appointment, causing the customer to leave a meeting. (Source: Angi review)
- Another customer reported having a windshield replaced but experiencing "condensation issues" afterward and stated **"Frank's Glass does not stand behind their work"** -- all they did was "a leak test." (Source: BBB complaint / Angi)
- A customer reported the technician "forgot to attach a cord in the rear view mirror" and the customer had been **"trying for a month to get management to admit to damage caused during the repair."** (Source: Angi review)
- One Birdeye review simply stated: **"Frank's Glass is a disgrace and please do not use them you would be very disappointed."** (Source: Birdeye review)
- Pattern: These complaints point to quality control gaps, no post-installation follow-up process, and difficulty escalating service issues to management -- suggesting a lack of ticketing/CRM and no structured warranty workflow.

**Workforce Contraction Signal:**
- Company history states they "quickly grew from a three-man operation to a business with over 20 employees." Current ZoomInfo data shows ~11 employees. This contraction from 20+ to ~11 could indicate lost market share, difficulty retaining staff, or intentional downsizing. Either way, it means a smaller team is covering the same service area with the same complexity.

**Positive Employee Review (Glassdoor) -- But Dated:**
- A Glassdoor reviewer praised owner Dan Brinkmann: "the owner truly caring for all of his employees and putting them first in decision making. Even during the economic downturn, the owner made minimal employee incentive cutbacks and zero layoffs." (Source: Glassdoor)
- This paints Dan as a loyal, people-first owner -- exactly the Reluctant Operator profile. He likely resists automation because he values the personal touch, but the complaints about late arrivals and warranty follow-up suggest the personal approach is not scaling.

**BBB Status:**
- Frank's Glass Inc. in Fairfield is NOT BBB Accredited. BBB "does not have sufficient information to issue a rating." (Source: bbb.org)
- For a 56-year-old family business, this absence is notable and may indicate administrative neglect (nobody managing external business profiles or reputation).

**Multi-Generation Transition:**
- The business is now entering its 3rd generation with Nathan Brinkmann (Commercial Manager). Managing a generational transition with ~11 employees, no visible operations technology, and customer complaints about service quality creates a natural moment for operational modernization.

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website (franksglass.com) appears to be a basic WordPress or template site
- Also operates a second URL: cincinnatiglassservice.com (redirects or mirrors content) -- fragmented web presence
- Contact via phone or website form only -- no online scheduling, no customer portal
- No mention of any FSM, CRM, or dispatch software
- Chamber of Commerce member (Greater Hamilton Chamber, Fairfield Chamber) -- engaged locally but no tech sophistication signals
- Listed on Blue Book (thebluebook.com) for commercial contractor network

### Why They're a Strong Prospect
Frank's Glass is a 56-year-old, 3rd-generation family business in Fairfield with ~$6M in revenue and ~11 employees serving auto, residential, and commercial glass. Dan Brinkmann is a people-first owner who took over from his father 30 years ago and is now bringing his son Nathan into the business. Customer complaints center on late arrivals, no follow-up after service, and difficulty reaching management about warranty issues -- all symptoms of a business running on informal processes. The workforce has contracted from 20+ to ~11, meaning fewer people are handling the same complexity. Dan is the textbook Reluctant Operator: loyal to his team, proud of his family legacy, but running the business on relationships and phone calls rather than systems.

## PROSPECT 3: Allied Glass & Mirror Co., Inc.
**Priority: 2-MEDIUM**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Allied Glass & Mirror Company, Inc. (operating as Allied Glass & Mirror LLC)
- **Website:** https://alliedglassandmirror.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 381-0096
- **Email:** Contact via website form (alliedglassandmirror.com/contact/); no public email address found
- **Location:** 2036 Reading Road, Cincinnati, OH 45202
- **Founded:** 1947 (79 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~6-12 (ZoomInfo says 6; other sources say 7-12; company claims "115 years of collective experience" across team)
- **Revenue:** ~$1M annually (RocketReach estimate)
- **Service Area:** Greater Cincinnati tri-state area (OH/KY/IN)
- **Services:** Architectural glass, restoration glass, custom mirrors, glass repair/replacement, shower enclosures, storefront glass repair, patterned glass, commercial glass installations
- **BBB Rating:** A+ (Accredited since 7/28/1999)

### Key People
- **Marty Mandel** -- Owner. Nephew of founder Norman Horwitz. Has run the company for decades and is now "preparing a third generation of future family leadership." LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/marty-mandel-701abb11 (Source: alliedglassandmirror.com/history/, LinkedIn)
- **Linda Mandel** -- Vice President. Likely Marty's wife or family member. (Source: ZoomInfo employee directory)
- **Zac Hiudt** -- Manager, Operations. Part of the "next generation" being groomed for leadership alongside the Mandel family. Company history states: "Norman, his nephew Marty Mandel and now Zac Hiudt have led the hard-working teams." (Source: alliedglassandmirror.com/history/, ZoomInfo)
- **Jimmy Farmer** -- Lead Glazier. 25+ years at Allied Glass. Now works alongside his son Tyler (apprentice). (Source: alliedglassandmirror.com blog post on working as a glazier)
- **Tyler Farmer** -- Apprentice Glazier (Jimmy's son). (Source: alliedglassandmirror.com)
- **David Cresswell** -- Glazier. (Source: ZoomInfo)

### Email Pattern
- No public email address found. Contact appears to be phone-only or via website contact form.
- Likely pattern: firstname@alliedglassandmirror.com or first initial + last@alliedglassandmirror.com (speculative)
- The lack of a public email address is itself a tech signal -- this is a phone-first business.

### Pain Signals

**Smaller Scale but High Complexity:**
- With ~6-12 employees and 79 years in business, Allied Glass handles both residential and commercial projects across the tri-state area. Their services range from custom mirrors to architectural glass to storefront repair. That breadth with a tiny team means every employee is wearing multiple hats.

**Generational Transition (Active):**
- Marty Mandel is actively preparing Zac Hiudt and the next generation for leadership. This is the exact moment when a business needs to formalize its processes -- what Marty carries in his head needs to become documented, repeatable systems. The transition from "Marty knows everything" to "the team can operate without Marty" is an operational modernization trigger.
- Additionally, lead glazier Jimmy Farmer (25+ years) is training his son Tyler as an apprentice. When Jimmy eventually retires, decades of institutional knowledge walk out the door unless it's captured in systems.

**Employee Review (Positive but Revealing):**
- Glassdoor review (October 2021, 5 stars): Pros included "Many different types of projects, variety" and "Freedom, out independently on installs most days." Cons: "occasionally we can [have] a physically grueling day Cincinnati summer heat + humidity, outside lifting big panes" but noted this was "usually totally tolerable." (Source: Glassdoor)
- The "out independently on installs most days" comment confirms glaziers operate solo in the field without centralized dispatch coordination -- they likely get assignments in the morning and manage their own day. This works at 6-12 people but would break down with any growth.

**No Public Email / Phone-First Culture:**
- Allied Glass has no publicly listed email address. Their contact page appears to be phone or web form only. This is a strong indicator of a phone-and-paper operation.

**Benefits Structure Suggests Small Shop Operations:**
- Company offers "80% coverage of health insurance costs, a retirement fund, a monthly company lunch, and paid vacation after a year, with automatic profit-sharing." (Source: alliedglassandmirror.com blog)
- These are good benefits for a small shop, but the informal description suggests they're managed manually rather than through an HRIS or automated payroll system.

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website (alliedglassandmirror.com) appears to be WordPress (blog posts, modern template)
- No online scheduling, no customer portal, no real-time job tracking
- No visible CRM, FSM, or dispatch software
- Phone-first contact (no public email)
- BBB Accredited since 1999 with A+ rating -- someone maintains this relationship, but overall digital presence is minimal
- Active blog content on website (articles about glass services, careers) suggests some marketing effort

### Why They're a Viable Prospect
Allied Glass & Mirror is a 79-year-old, family-run Cincinnati institution with deep roots and loyal employees. At ~6-12 employees and ~$1M revenue, they're on the smaller end of the target range but still qualified. The prospect value here is timing: Marty Mandel is actively transitioning leadership to the next generation (Zac Hiudt), and their longest-tenured glazier (Jimmy Farmer, 25 years) is training his son as a replacement. This dual generational transition creates a natural moment to systematize operations. The business runs on phone calls, field independence, and Marty's institutional knowledge. The risk is that at ~$1M revenue and 6-12 people, the budget for ops software may be tight. Best approached as a "set up the next generation for success" conversation.

## PROSPECT 4: Hilltop Glass & Mirror, LLC
**Priority: 3-MEDIUM**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Hilltop Glass & Mirror, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.hilltopglass.co/
- **Phone:** (513) 931-3688
- **Email:** sales@hilltopglass.co (confirmed from search results)
- **Location:** 7612 Hamilton Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45231 (Mount Healthy, OH)
- **Founded:** 1954 (72 years in business); under new ownership since October 2011
- **Employees:** ~5 (Manta.com estimate; owner confirmed "a staff of five")
- **Revenue:** ~$608K annually (Manta.com estimate)
- **Service Area:** Greater Cincinnati area
- **Services:** Residential and commercial glass replacement/repair, mirrors, screen repair, shower enclosures, insulated glass, furniture tops, safety glass
- **Hours:** M-F 8:30 AM - 5:00 PM; special appointments available after hours
- **BBB Rating:** Accredited since 6/5/2013

### Key People
- **Cindy Jurcenko** -- Owner (since October 2011). Purchased the business after walking into the store looking for a window for a craft project. Learned the glazier's trade in the 1980s in West Virginia. Also operates Hilltop Glass Creations (stained glass, fused glass art studio) at the same location. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/cindy-jurcenko-42643223 (Source: LinkedIn, Cincinnati Refined / Local12, Mt. Healthy Renaissance)
- **No other named staff** -- Cindy is the public face of the business. With only 5 employees total, there is likely no dedicated office manager, dispatcher, or operations person. Cindy is handling owner duties, customer-facing work, quoting, scheduling, and possibly still doing hands-on glass work.

### Email Pattern
- Generic/Sales: sales@hilltopglass.co (confirmed)
- Cindy Jurcenko: likely cindy@hilltopglass.co (speculative)
- Call to verify before sending cold email

### Pain Signals

**Scheduling & Communication Breakdowns (Customer Complaints):**
- A customer reported: **"Communication was very poor, with several reschedules because they were always doing a school project."** The customer had to "rearrange their schedule and wait, then call to check where they were and if they were coming." (Source: Angi review)
- Same or similar reviewer: noticed "scratches in the glass about a week later, and had to schedule replacements multiple times with weather-related delays." (Source: Angi review)
- Another review: **"Customer service is bad and not responsive to customers questions and not on time"** and staff were **"argumentative when asked for a return call when installer was enroute."** (Source: Angi/BBB review)
- Another customer: **"asking for service was an inconvenience to them."** (Source: review aggregator)
- A BBB/review complaint: company "made too many mistakes and they were not willing to do the work to fix their mistakes properly." (Source: Angi review)
- Pattern: These reviews describe a business where the phone doesn't get answered reliably, scheduling is chaotic, there's no proactive communication about delays, and there's defensiveness when customers push back. With only 5 people and no office manager, the owner is likely the bottleneck on all customer communication.

**Owner Wearing Too Many Hats:**
- Cindy Jurcenko operates BOTH Hilltop Glass & Mirror (the service business) and Hilltop Glass Creations (the art/stained glass studio) from the same location. She's running two businesses with 5 total employees. The "school project" delays mentioned in the review likely reference her art classes/workshops conflicting with service appointments.
- This dual-business model means the glass repair service may be deprioritized when the art studio has events or classes, creating the scheduling chaos customers describe.

**New Ownership Transition (2011) -- Still Stabilizing?:**
- Cindy bought the 57-year-old business in 2011 (15 years ago). The customer complaints about service quality and scheduling suggest the operational challenges of running a legacy trade business have persisted.

**Member of GCNKAA:**
- Hilltop Glass is a member of the Greater Cincinnati Northern Kentucky Apartment Association, indicating they do multi-unit residential work for property managers -- a client segment that demands reliability and fast response times, which their reviews suggest they struggle to deliver.

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website (hilltopglass.co) is a very basic template site (Wix or Squarespace-style; .co domain is unusual for a traditional glass shop)
- Also operates hilltopglasscreations.com for the art side -- fragmented web presence across two businesses
- Contact via phone or email (sales@hilltopglass.co) -- no online scheduling, no customer portal
- Active on Quora (unusual -- hilltopgla4.quora.com) and Nextdoor for local marketing
- No visible CRM, FSM, or dispatch software

### Why They're a Viable Prospect (with Caveats)
Hilltop Glass is at the very bottom of the target employee range (5 people) and revenue (~$608K), which makes budget a concern. However, the pain signals are extremely strong: customer reviews consistently describe scheduling chaos, poor communication, and defensive responses. The owner is splitting her attention between a service business and an art studio, and there's no office manager or dispatcher to handle the coordination. The GCNKAA membership means they serve apartment/property management clients who expect reliable, schedulable service -- a standard Hilltop is visibly not meeting. If Ops for Shops has a lower-tier offering or entry-level price point, Hilltop Glass is a compelling case study in "what happens when a 5-person shop has zero operational infrastructure." Best approached as: "You're clearly talented at your craft -- let's get the business side organized so you can focus on what you do best."

## RESEARCH NOTES & ADDITIONAL CANDIDATES CONSIDERED

### Companies Researched but Not Qualified

**Glenny Glass (Milford, OH):**
- 95+ employees, 107,000 sq ft facility, two operating shifts. Too large for target range. Sophisticated operation with dedicated management.

**Cincinnati Glass LLC (Cleves, OH):**
- Founded 2008 by Don Bloemker. Commercial-only (storefronts, curtain walls). Employee count and revenue data not available. Listed on Procore. May be worth revisiting if more data emerges. Contact: d***@cinciglass.com per ZoomInfo.

**Custom Glass & Glazing LLC (Cincinnati, OH):**
- Owner: John Iaciofano. Family owned, 35 years experience. Uses union glaziers -- which suggests a more structured operation and higher costs. Primarily commercial. j***@customglassandglazing.com per ZoomInfo. May be worth a second look.

**American Auto Glass (Cincinnati, OH):**
- Located at 1672 Queen City Ave. Managing Partners: Troy Haney and Steve Brissey. Auto glass only (no residential/commercial diversification). Founded 2005. 33 Yelp reviews. Could be a secondary prospect if auto-glass-only companies are in scope.

**GlassPro Inc. (Cincinnati, OH):**
- Auto glass specialist serving since 2000. Team of dedicated specialists. Fully insured. Contact: autoglassrepairandreplace.com. Limited info on ownership and employee count.

**Kiss Auto Glass (West Chester Township, OH):**
- 14+ years serving tri-state. Auto-glass only. 8895 Cincinnati Columbus Rd, West Chester Township, OH 45069. Limited info available.

**Inst-I-Glass (Cincinnati, OH):**
- Multi-state operation (9 locations: IL, KY, MI, MO, OH, TN). May be too large or franchise-like. Not clearly independent/local.

**Absolute Glass LLC (Cincinnati, OH):**
- Commercial glass specialist. Phone: (859) 356-6789 (Kentucky area code suggests NKY base). Limited ownership/employee data available.

### Industry Pain Patterns Observed Across Glass Companies

1. **Scheduling/Dispatch is the #1 complaint category.** Across all companies reviewed, customer complaints about missed appointments, late arrivals, no-shows, and lack of proactive communication far outnumber complaints about glass quality. This is an operational problem, not a craftsmanship problem.

2. **Measurement errors are endemic.** Multiple companies had reviews mentioning wrong measurements, re-cuts, and return trips. This points to a lack of standardized measurement checklists or field-to-shop communication workflows.

3. **No company in this research has visible dispatch or FSM software.** None of the companies reviewed showed any evidence of scheduling software, customer portals, real-time job tracking, or automated appointment reminders on their websites.

4. **Family businesses dominate the market.** Every qualified prospect is a multi-generational family business. This means the operational knowledge lives in the owner's head, and transitions between generations are natural inflection points for modernization.

5. **Three-division complexity (auto + residential + commercial) creates the most pain.** Companies serving all three segments have the most scheduling complaints because each segment has different workflows, lead times, and crew requirements.

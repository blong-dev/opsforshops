## PROSPECT 1: Perfection Pest Control, Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Perfection Pest Control, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.perfectionpest.com/
- **Phone:** (859) 525-8560
- **Email:** info@perfectionpest.com
- **Location:** 9967 Old Union Rd, Union, KY 41091
- **Founded:** March 1998 (28 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~14 (sources vary 10-19)
- **Revenue:** ~$4M annually (RocketReach/ZoomInfo estimates)
- **Service Area:** Northern Kentucky, Greater Cincinnati OH, and Indiana (tri-state)
- **Services:** General pest control, termite treatment, bed bug removal, wildlife control/removal, rodent control, stinging insects

### Key People
- **Tim Leatherman** -- President & Founder. 44+ years in pest and wildlife management. Worked 18 years as inspector, sales manager, and VP before founding Perfection Pest. Served on the Board of Directors for NPMA (National Pest Management Association). Active in P.E.S.T. Relief International charity. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/tim-leatherman-7576/
- **Named technicians from Meet the Team page:** Denny, Doug, Vic, Russ, plus a Branch Manager (former Army Reserve Veteran, 9 years), and multiple licensed technicians in OH/KY/IN. One team member has been in pest management since 1996.
- **No Office Manager or Ops Manager publicly identified** -- this is a key signal. Tim likely manages both field operations and back-office, or has an unnamed person handling it.

### Email Pattern
- Generic: info@perfectionpest.com (confirmed from website)
- Tim Leatherman: tim@perfectionpest.com or tleatherman@perfectionpest.com (inferred; RocketReach lists contact)
- Call to verify before sending

### Pain Signals

**Growth & Acquisition Strain:**
- Perfection Pest acquired **Responsible Services** (northern Cincinnati / southern Dayton area). Tim Leatherman stated publicly that the acquisition "fits into Perfection Pest Control's growth plans into the northern Cincinnati to southern Dayton area." (Source: PCT Online - pctonline.com/news/perfection-acquires-responsbile/)
- Integrating an acquired company's routes, customers, and processes into a 14-person operation creates significant operational strain -- especially without dedicated ops software.
- Also operates a second website: cincinnatipestcontrolservices.com for the Perfection Residential brand -- dual web properties signal fragmented customer funnels.

**Pricing Complaints from Customers:**
- Angi reviews (4.9/5 overall) note: "pricing can be higher than expected, leading to mixed feelings about value for money" (Source: Angi)
- This can indicate quoting inconsistencies or lack of standardized pricing sheets -- a process problem, not a value problem.

**BBB Status:**
- NOT BBB Accredited. BBB states "does not have sufficient information to issue a rating." (Source: bbb.org/us/ky/union/profile/pest-control/perfection-pest-control-inc-0292-1216410)
- For a 28-year-old company with a NPMA board member as owner, this is unusual and may reflect administrative neglect (nobody managing the BBB relationship).

**Staffing & Licensing Complexity:**
- Team members hold licenses across THREE states (Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana). Managing license renewals, continuing education, and state-specific compliance documentation across 3 states with a 14-person team is a significant back-office burden.
- One team member's bio describes progression from "Start Tech to Branch Manager" -- suggesting Perfection has at least a branch structure but may not have branch-level admin support.

**Industry Engagement Signals:**
- NPMA QualityPro certified company
- Angie's List Super Service Award three years running
- P.E.S.T. Relief International partner (hosted REST Initiative)
- Tim is active in industry leadership but that time away from day-to-day operations creates a management gap

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website appears to be a modern template site (likely WordPress or similar CMS)
- "Pick Your Plan" page on website suggests standardized service tiers -- but no online booking or scheduling visible
- No customer portal visible
- No mention of any FSM (Field Service Management) software
- Contact is phone or web form only
- Dual websites (perfectionpest.com + cincinnatipestcontrolservices.com) suggest fragmented marketing/ops

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Perfection Pest is a growing company actively acquiring competitors (Responsible Services) and expanding geographically from NKY into Cincinnati and Dayton -- but doing it with ~14 people and no visible operations technology. Tim Leatherman is an industry veteran with board-level connections, which means he understands best practices but may not have operationalized them internally. The acquisition integration, tri-state licensing complexity, and absence of any identified office manager or ops technology make this a textbook case of operational strain outpacing infrastructure. Tim is likely the Reluctant Operator who built the business on his expertise and reputation but now needs systems to support the growth.

## PROSPECT 2: Pest All Exterminating Co.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Pest All Exterminating Co.
- **Website:** https://www.pestallexterminating.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 951-5621
- **Fax:** (513) 531-1261 (still listed -- a tech signal in itself)
- **Location:** 5005 Montgomery Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45212
- **Founded:** 1968 (58 years in business)
- **Employees:** Estimated 8-15 (second-generation family, multiple employees with 20+ year tenure)
- **Revenue:** Not publicly disclosed; estimated $1-3M based on company size and market
- **Service Area:** Greater Cincinnati, Norwood, Northern Kentucky, Southwest Ohio tri-state region
- **Services:** Bed bugs, termites, fleas, ants, cockroaches, rodents, bees, seasonal pests

### Key People
- **Peter Anderson Jr.** -- President. Second-generation owner. Took over from his father Peter T. Anderson Sr. Email partial from ZoomInfo: p***@pestallexterminating.com (likely panderson@pestallexterminating.com)
- **Peter T. Anderson Sr.** -- Founder/CEO. **DECEASED as of March 2025.** Created Pest-All in 1968, purchased it in 1979. Survived by wife Jeanne, son Peter Jr. (Tracy), daughter Lorie Rumsey (Joe), and 5 grandchildren. Funeral held March 7-8, 2025 at Geo. H. Rohde & Son Funeral Home, Mount Lookout. (Source: rohdefuneral.com/obituary/peter-anderson)
- **Adam McPherson** -- Pest Control Route Technician. Also sole proprietor of Critter Combat LLC (side business). (Source: LinkedIn)
- **Doug Smith** -- Sales Inspector (referenced in ZoomInfo employee directory)
- **No Office Manager publicly identified**

### Email Pattern
- Peter Anderson Jr.: panderson@pestallexterminating.com (inferred from ZoomInfo partial p***@)
- Pattern likely: first-initial + last @pestallexterminating.com
- Call to verify before sending

### Pain Signals

**CRITICAL: Generational Transition After Founder's Death (March 2025)**
- Peter Anderson Sr., the founder who built and ran Pest-All for 40+ years, passed away in March 2025. Peter Jr. is now running the company alone as second-generation owner.
- This is the single most significant operational pain signal in this entire prospect list. The institutional knowledge that lived in the founder's head for 57 years is gone. Peter Jr. must now operationalize what was likely an informal, relationship-based operation.
- The obituary notes Pete Jr. joined the business, allowing his father to "step back" -- implying Peter Sr. was still involved until relatively recently.

**Long-Tenure Employees = Institutional Knowledge Risk:**
- "Multiple employees with greater than 20 years at Pest-All" (Source: Yelp company description)
- This is a double-edged sword: loyal team but all their processes live in their heads. If any of these 20+ year employees leave or retire, the knowledge goes with them. After losing the founder, this risk is acute.

**Customer Complaints Signal Process Gaps:**
- BBB: A+ rated, accredited since 1991. No major complaints.
- However, customer reviews reveal operational issues:
  - **Ineffective treatment for ants**: "Purchased a six-month ant and roach treatment package but after 6 months still had a problem with ants." Another customer: "Ants kept coming back year after year in greater force, and over-the-counter Raid gels seemed to help more than the service." (Source: Angi reviews) -- This suggests technician training inconsistency or lack of standardized treatment protocols.
  - **Staff professionalism issue**: One customer reported a technician was "mean and hateful" during a roach spray visit and "argued with them during a follow-up visit and was disrespectful in their home." (Source: Angi reviews) -- This is a field management and training gap.
- Positive counterbalance: one customer of 30+ years "never having to complain about the service" and another praised bed bug treatment after a "unsuccessful treatment from a competitor." 4.8/5 on Angi overall.

**No Online Booking, No Customer Portal:**
- Website offers free estimates via phone call or web contact form only
- Same-day service advertised -- which with a small team means reactive scheduling, not optimized routing
- Fax number still prominently listed
- Still a member of the Norwood Chamber of Commerce (local, relationship-driven marketing)

**Employee Side Business:**
- Route technician Adam McPherson runs "Critter Combat LLC" on the side -- this may indicate he feels undercompensated or sees opportunity the company isn't capturing (wildlife removal as add-on service)

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website appears to be a basic template CMS (likely WordPress)
- No customer portal or online scheduling
- Fax number listed prominently
- No evidence of any FSM, CRM, or routing software
- Contact form is the only digital touchpoint
- Likely running on paper route sheets, QuickBooks, and phone calls

### Why They're a Good Prospect
This is a company in acute transition. The founder died less than a year ago (March 2025). Peter Jr. is now running a 58-year-old business that was built on his father's personal relationships and institutional memory, with a small team of long-tenure employees whose processes all live in their heads. There's no visible technology infrastructure, they still list a fax number, and they advertise same-day service with what appears to be fewer than 15 people. The generational handoff is THE moment when an operator realizes "we can't keep doing things the way Dad did." This is the highest-urgency prospect on the list because the window of receptivity to operational change is open right now.

## PROSPECT 3: Sure Thing Pest Control, LLC
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Sure Thing Pest Control, LLC
- **Website:** https://surethingpc.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 247-0030
- **Email:** help@surethingpc.com (confirmed); also info@surethingpc.com (directory listing)
- **Location:** 11541 Goldcoast Dr, Cincinnati, OH 45249 (Blue Ash area)
- **Founded:** 1997/1998 (LLC incorporated 3/21/2005; BBB start date 1/1/1998). ~28 years in business.
- **Employees:** 12 (ZoomInfo)
- **Revenue:** $2-4.2M annually (LeadIQ reports $2M; Kona Equity reports $4.2M; Salary.com says $1-5M)
- **Service Area:** Greater Cincinnati OH and Northern Kentucky (Ft. Thomas, Florence, and surrounding areas)
- **Services:** General pest control, termite treatment, bed bug extermination, rodent control, mosquito control, stink bug control, tick control, spider control, nuisance animal removal

### Key People
- **Jerry Zapf** -- Co-Owner. 30+ years of pest control experience.
- **Glenn Scherzinger** -- Co-Owner / President. 30+ years experience. Also President of **Showcase Turf & Tree** (one of the largest lawn care companies in Cincinnati, which he started and owned) and a **Christmas Lighting Company**. Glenn cofounded Sure Thing after building Showcase Turf. NOTE: Glenn is a **Scherzinger** -- likely related to the Scherzinger Pest Control family (Steve/Kurt Scherzinger), though Sure Thing operates independently.
- **Operations Manager** -- unnamed, but confirmed to exist via Indeed review (current employee, Blue Ash location)
- **No Office Manager publicly named**

### Email Pattern
- Generic: help@surethingpc.com (confirmed from website)
- Also: info@surethingpc.com (directory listing)
- Owner emails not publicly confirmed. Try: jerry@surethingpc.com, glenn@surethingpc.com, or jzapf@surethingpc.com, gscherzinger@surethingpc.com
- Call to verify before sending

### Pain Signals

**BBB C+ Rating -- Failure to Respond to Complaint:**
- Sure Thing Pest Control has a **C+ rating from BBB** due to **failure to respond to 1 complaint filed against the business.** (Source: bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/pest-control/sure-thing-pest-control-llc-0292-1224063)
- A company that fails to respond to a BBB complaint likely has no administrative process for monitoring and managing external communications -- the Backbone is missing or overwhelmed.

**Indeed Employee Reviews Reveal Operational Signals:**
- 4.0/5 overall on Indeed (3 reviews)
- **Operations Manager (current employee, Blue Ash):** "Relaxed atmosphere with realistic expectations." Praised "hours, freedom to schedule and set your pace" and described it as "family friendly." Also stated the company's future is "very steady, well grounded with great reputation." (Source: Indeed)
  - Key insight: "freedom to schedule and set your pace" = technicians are self-routing, not centrally dispatched. This means no route optimization.
- **Pest Control Technician (current employee, Cincinnati):** Rated 2.0/5. Described it as "a fun place to work" but noted the location was in Blue Ash with a "30-minute commute" and worked **part-time at 10 hours per week.**
  - Key insight: A tech working only 10 hours/week suggests either underutilization, seasonal downturn management, or inability to fill a full route. This is a scheduling/capacity optimization problem.

**Co-Owner Running Multiple Businesses:**
- Glenn Scherzinger simultaneously runs Sure Thing Pest Control, Showcase Turf & Tree, and a Christmas Lighting Company. His attention is divided across at least three businesses.
- This means Sure Thing likely operates with minimal owner oversight day-to-day. The Operations Manager (unnamed) and Jerry Zapf are probably running things, but without Glenn's full attention, strategic operational improvements get deferred.

**Scherzinger Family Connection:**
- Glenn Scherzinger shares a surname with the ScherZinger Pest Control family (Steve Scherzinger, CEO; Kurt Scherzinger, President). ScherZinger Pest Control is a much larger operation (~50+ employees, $20-50M revenue, actively acquiring companies like Aimvo Ohio).
- This creates an interesting dynamic: Sure Thing may feel competitive pressure from the larger family operation, or may eventually be an acquisition target. Either way, operational efficiency becomes critical for maintaining independence or maximizing sale value.

**No Visible Technology:**
- Website has no online booking, no customer portal
- 16 reviews on Yelp over ~28 years = very low digital engagement
- Angie's List Super Service Award winner 13 years in a row (2005-2017+) = strong referral business but not digitally driven

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website is a modern template (likely WordPress with SEO-focused content pages for each pest type)
- No online booking or customer portal
- No FSM or scheduling software visible
- Strong SEO play with dedicated pages for each pest type and service area (Cincinnati spider control, Cincinnati mosquito control, etc.) -- this suggests they hired a marketing agency but haven't invested in operations technology
- Phone and email are the only contact methods

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Sure Thing is a 12-person company generating $2-4M in revenue with co-owners whose attention is split across multiple businesses, an unnamed Operations Manager running day-to-day, technicians who self-route ("freedom to schedule and set your pace"), a BBB complaint they failed to respond to, and no visible operations technology. The Indeed review from a tech working only 10 hours/week suggests scheduling inefficiency. The co-owner's connection to the larger ScherZinger Pest Control family means they either need to become more efficient to compete independently or get acquired -- both scenarios benefit from better operations. The Angie's List awards prove the service quality is there; it's the back-office that's lagging.

## PROSPECT 4: Delhi Pest Control (Project Bug, LLC)
**Priority: 2-MED (Timing Opportunity)**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Delhi Pest Control Inc. (now operating as Project Bug, LLC under new ownership)
- **Website:** https://delhipest.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 451-1800
- **Location:** 4737 Delhi Rd (Delhi Pike), Cincinnati, OH 45238
- **Founded:** Original business 1982 (44 years); new entity Project Bug, LLC incorporated 3/28/2024; new ownership effective 6/12/2024
- **Employees:** 4-5 (website says 5; Angi says 4; RocketReach says 2; combined experience of 165 years)
- **Revenue:** ~$2.8M annually (RocketReach estimate)
- **Service Area:** Greater Cincinnati, OH / Northern KY
- **Services:** General pest control, termite control, stinging insects, rodent control, real estate assessments/inspections, ant control, water-conducive bugs

### Key People
- **TJ Adams** -- Owner (as of June 2024). Listed as owner and principal contact on BBB. Operates under Project Bug, LLC.
- **Previous Owners:** Bob & Diana Grinkemeyer -- built and operated Delhi Pest Control from 1982 until sale in 2024. Bob served on the County Advisory Board. (Source: countyadvisoryboard.com)
- **Staff mentioned in reviews:** Barry (technician, noted as "very friendly, professional, and helpful"), Jim, Tom, Bob
- **No Office Manager publicly identified** -- with 5 employees, TJ Adams is likely owner-operator handling everything

### Email Pattern
- Generic: Contact form on delhipest.com
- Owner: tj@delhipest.com (inferred; unconfirmed)
- BBB lists email contacts for Primary, Sales, Technical Support, and Customer Service but does not display addresses publicly
- Call to verify before sending

### Pain Signals

**CRITICAL: New Ownership Transition (June 2024)**
- TJ Adams purchased Delhi Pest Control ~8 months ago, inheriting a 42-year-old business built by the Grinkemeyers.
- The business was reincorporated as "Project Bug, LLC" on 3/28/2024 and began operating under new ownership on 6/12/2024. BBB accreditation was obtained 4/7/2025 (10 months after purchase). (Source: BBB profile)
- New owners inheriting legacy businesses are in the highest receptivity window for operational change. TJ is still learning how the business works and hasn't yet calcified into "the way we've always done it."

**Active Hiring -- Growth Signal:**
- Delhi Pest Control has **active job postings** on Glassdoor and Indeed:
  - **Licensed Termite Technician**: "Seeking a Licensed Termite Technician to join their growing team." Requires Ohio pest control license with termite certification. (Source: Glassdoor)
  - **Pest Control Technician**: Works from home, services Cincinnati OH/Northern KY, provided company truck, competitive comp, benefits including vacation, sick time, medical insurance, 401(k). Manages assigned territory monthly. Clients range from restaurants to food plants to office buildings to residential. (Source: Indeed)
- Hiring for licensed technicians + offering benefits (medical, 401k) from a 5-person company signals aggressive growth ambitions. TJ Adams is scaling up.

**Tiny Team with Massive Institutional Knowledge Concentration:**
- 5 employees with "165 years combined experience" = average 33 years experience per person
- These are the Grinkemeyer-era employees. Their processes, customer relationships, route knowledge, and treatment protocols all live in their heads. If any of them leave (and a new owner is a common trigger for departures), Delhi loses decades of knowledge overnight.

**Scheduling & Communication Gaps:**
- Customer review: "My only problem is that they said they would send out the same repair person who had been here before, and they didn't." (Source: Birdeye/review aggregators) -- Technician assignment consistency is a scheduling problem.
- Another review praised: "They were friendly and always on time" and "The woman who answered the phone made us feel comfortable about our problem." -- The phone-answering person (unnamed, likely one of the 5 employees doubling as scheduler/receptionist) is a Backbone.

**No Online Booking:**
- Website has a contact form and phone number only
- No customer portal, no online scheduling, no self-service
- For a business actively hiring and growing, this is a bottleneck

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website is a modern, clean design (likely a template CMS -- WordPress or Squarespace)
- No online booking or customer portal
- No evidence of FSM, CRM, or routing software
- Contact is phone or web form only
- Uses Birdeye for reputation management (183 reviews aggregated)
- Likely QuickBooks and phone-based scheduling given company size
- BBB profile lists separate email contacts for Sales, Tech Support, and Customer Service -- but this could just be aliases for the same inbox

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Delhi Pest Control is at the exact inflection point where operational investment matters most. A new owner (TJ Adams) purchased a 42-year-old business 8 months ago, is actively hiring to grow it, and is inheriting a team of 5 long-tenure employees whose processes are entirely in their heads. The business has strong reviews (4.9/5 with 183 reviews on Birdeye, 5.0 on Angi), proving the service quality is excellent -- but TJ needs to build the operational infrastructure to scale without breaking what makes it work. He's already offering benefits and 401(k) to attract talent, which shows investment seriousness. The timing window is ideal: new enough that he hasn't built bad habits, but established enough that he has revenue and a customer base to protect.

## COMPANIES RESEARCHED BUT NOT QUALIFIED

### ScherZinger Pest Control
- **Why excluded:** Too large. ~50+ employees, $20-50M revenue (sources vary from $20.8M to $50M). Third and fourth generation family business (Steve Scherzinger CEO, Kurt Scherzinger President). Actively acquiring companies (purchased Aimvo Ohio Pest Control March 2024). Operates across Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky, Dayton, and Columbus. This is a mid-market company, not a small business needing operational help -- they likely have dedicated operations staff and may already use enterprise software.

### Tri-Stec Pest Control (Tri-Stec, The Pest Authority)
- **Why excluded:** Too small. Described as a "one man operation" on Nextdoor. Tom Stecher is the owner-operator, founded 1984. Located at 6215 Berauer Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45248. Phone: (513) 574-0188. While he's been in business 42 years, a sole proprietor doesn't need multi-user operations software.

### Valley Termite & Pest Control
- **Already in prospect list** as a Blue Collar Services prospect (line 126 of prospect-list.csv). Owner: Tami Burkel. ~15 employees. 60+ year family business. Female-owned. 5.0 Angi rating. No identifiable FSM or scheduling software. Worth considering as a parallel prospect in the pest control vertical but already documented.

### Affordable Pest Control, Inc.
- **Why excluded as standalone:** Owner-operated by Darin Dennis since 1981. Fairfield, OH. While established (45 years), appears to be very small (owner-operated) with limited public data on employee count. Would need phone verification to determine if they meet the 5+ employee threshold. Lower priority given stronger candidates above.

### A.G. Pest Control
- **Why excluded:** Founded 2010 by Angela Moniaci. Appears to be a very small operation (likely 1-3 people). Insufficient data to qualify and likely below the 5-employee minimum.

# Ops for Shops — Voice & Tone Guide

## Who's Talking
B. First person, always. "I" not "we." You're one person and that's the point.

## Who We're Talking To
The person at the desk — not the firm, not the industry. Three avatars:
- **The Backbone** — office manager holding everything together with duct tape and determination
- **The Reluctant Operator** — owner who started a business and accidentally became IT
- **The Mid-Migration Marketer** — the "tech-savvy one" drowning in a vendor switch

They share the same pain: competent people being failed by their systems, not the other way around.

## Voice Rules
- **Their language, not yours.** "Our systems don't talk to each other," not "integration architecture review." If a managing partner wouldn't say it at lunch, don't write it.
- **Direct over clever.** Say what you mean. No marketing-speak, no buzzwords, no jargon.
- **Peer tone.** Sitting across the table, not presenting from a stage.
- **Conviction without aggression.** The About page energy — passionate but not combative on the lander.
- **Cincinnati is a feature.** Local presence is a differentiator, say it.
- **Never condescend.** These are smart people who hit the limits of their domain, not people who need rescuing.

## Content Themes

### Person (who is this guy?)
Worldview, philosophy, frameworks. Systems thinking, data sovereignty, what you believe about work and technology. This is what makes you memorable. The philosopher who builds.

### Real Problems (what does he actually do?)
Cincinnati business reality. Compliance gaps, operational debt, tech that isn't working. Specific pain in specific verticals — law, accounting, real estate, non-profits. Show you understand the terrain.

### Invite (here's how to start)
Direct but earned. Not always "hire me." Can be "DM me if this resonated," a question, or a case insight. Soft and hard invites alternating. Once per week max.

## Headline & Tagline
- **Headline:** Your Data Should Work For You.
- **Tagline:** Never send a human to do a computer's job.

## Words We Use
- data, numbers, tools, software
- connect, automate, clean up, line up
- time back, trust your reports, go home on time
- Cincinnati, local, your business

## Words We Don't Use
- systems (too broad, reads HVAC)
- tech (reads IT/wifi)
- digital transformation, solutions, leverage, optimize
- synergy, stakeholder, deliverables
- any consultant jargon

## Pricing Language
- Free 30-minute conversation — no pitch, no commitment
- Small Business Tune-Up — $500, credited toward any project that follows
- Build and retainer pricing comes from the Tune-Up, not the website

## The Test
Before publishing any copy, ask: would the Backbone read this and feel seen? Would the Reluctant Operator feel like he's talking to a peer? Would either of them feel stupid or sold to? If yes to the last two, rewrite.

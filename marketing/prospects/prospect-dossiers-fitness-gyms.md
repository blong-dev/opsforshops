- **Paul Bain** -- Owner. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/paul-bain-840444217/
- **Stephanie Willow** -- President (Source: ZoomInfo)

### Email Pattern
- stephanie@bodyalivefitness.com (owner, CONFIRMED)
- info@bodyalivefitness.com (GENERIC/CONFIRMED on website)
- Pattern: firstname@bodyalivefitness.com

### Pain Signals

**Glassdoor Employee Reviews (35 reviews, 2.0/5 stars -- extremely low):**
- "Can be disorganized and roles are constantly changing." (Source: Glassdoor)
- "Fired employees unexpectedly with no explanation." (Source: Glassdoor)
- "Manipulative and deceitful, the ownership is known for driving good employees away, if not, firing without cause (and often, without notice)." (Source: Glassdoor)
- "There was no system in place to hold the leadership accountable when there was unfair or inappropriate treatment." (Source: Glassdoor)
- "The owner ruins it for everyone." (Source: Indeed)
- Only 11% of employees would recommend working at Body Alive to a friend (Glassdoor)
- Work-life balance: 2.5/5, Culture: 2.1/5, Career opportunities: 2.0/5, Compensation: 1.9/5

**BBB Complaints -- Billing/Membership Issues:**
- Customer complaint: "I feel deceived and tricked. I signed up for a 6 week/$36 trial period." (Source: BBB)
- $10 penalty fee for late cancellation ($15 at Mason location) -- friction point

**Multi-Location Complexity:**
- 6 physical locations across 3 states plus online platform = massive coordination challenge for scheduling, instructor management, and consistent operations

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Custom mobile app:** "Body Alive Fitness" app on iOS App Store for class scheduling and booking
- **Website:** WordPress-based (bodyalivefitness.com)
- **Booking:** Appears to use their own app rather than Mindbody; also listed on ClassPass and Wellhub
- **Online streaming:** Custom video platform at video.bodyalivefitness.com

### Why Ops for Shops
Body Alive is a rapidly growing multi-location fitness brand with severe internal operations problems documented by a 2.0 Glassdoor rating. Employee reviews consistently cite disorganization, constantly changing roles, and lack of accountability systems. With 64 employees across 6 locations and an online platform, they need standardized processes, better internal communication, and operational consistency -- exactly what Ops for Shops delivers.

## PROSPECT 2: Cincinnati Sports Club
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Cincinnati Sports Club
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatisportsclub.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 527-4000
- **Email:** Website contact form (GENERIC -- no public email found)
- **Location:** 3950 Red Bank Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45227
- **Type:** Full-service luxury fitness & social club
- **Founded:** 1990 (36 years, locally and privately owned)
- **Employees:** 84-121 (Sources: ZoomInfo, RocketReach, CBInsights)
- **Facility:** 110,000 sq ft on 15 acres -- indoor track, indoor & outdoor pools, splash pad, racquet sports, basketball, group fitness, spinning, yoga, Pilates, private training
- **BBB:** Listed

### Key People
- **Marco Fiorini** -- President & CEO (appointed April 2025; Source: Club Solutions Magazine)
- Previous leadership team not publicly identified

### Email Pattern
- Contact form on website; no public email addresses found
- Email confidence: UNKNOWN -- will need to infer pattern or use contact form

### Pain Signals

**Glassdoor Employee Reviews (25 reviews, 3.6/5 stars):**
- "Management is awful. Looks great on paper but is run terribly." (Source: Glassdoor)
- "You will not receive much guidance from the management team... you will want to rely solely on your coworkers and seasoned associates, because they will provide more information than your own manager will be able to." (Source: Indeed)
- "Only if lucky, an employee will actually have a manager that has communicative skills." (Source: Indeed)
- "Little to no communication and constantly being short staffed." (Source: Indeed)
- "They don't worry about booking you, and ostracize you if you need any amount of time off, even if your books aren't ever full." (Source: Indeed, massage therapist review)
- "The system is pretty much set up for you to succeed if you are not a student or have a social life outside of work." (Source: Indeed)
- "Bureaucratic nightmare with employees on a totem pole." (Source: Indeed)

**New CEO = Transition Window:**
- Marco Fiorini appointed President & CEO in April 2025. New leadership often means operational overhauls, new vendor evaluations, and openness to outside solutions.

**Scale + Single Location:**
- 84-121 employees in one massive facility = significant scheduling, communication, and coordination challenge without proper systems.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **EGYM:** Smart strength training system added in 2024 (cloud-based fitness technology)
- **Website:** Custom/CMS (cincinnatisportsclub.com)

### Why Ops for Shops
Cincinnati Sports Club is the largest independent fitness facility in the market with 100+ employees, a brand-new CEO, and documented management/communication breakdowns. The new CEO transition is the perfect window to pitch operational improvements. Employee reviews consistently cite lack of communication, poor scheduling, and management gaps -- all solvable with better ops tooling.

**NOTE:** At 84-121 employees, CSC may slightly exceed the 5-80 employee sweet spot. Evaluate fit based on conversation.

## PROSPECT 3: Fitworks Fitness Centers
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Fitworks, LLC
- **Website:** https://fitworks.com/
- **Phone:** Contact varies by location
- **Email:** Website contact form (GENERIC)
- **Location (HQ):** Parma, OH (corporate); Cincinnati-area locations include White Oak (5840 Cheviot Rd) and West Chester (7060 Ridgetop Dr)
- **Type:** Full-service gym chain (locally owned)
- **Founded:** 1996 (30 years)
- **Employees:** ~64 at corporate (Source: ZoomInfo); likely 100+ across all locations
- **Locations:** ~9 locations across Ohio (Cleveland, Akron, Cincinnati, Dayton) and Northern Kentucky (Florence, Newport)
- **Services:** Full gym amenities, personal training, group fitness, cardio, strength, pools

### Key People
- **Linda Ortiz** -- Owner & Operator
- **Laurie Ayers-Hughey** -- Group Fitness Director & Instructor
- **Michael Cross** -- Regional Sales & Marketing Director
- **Jermaine L. Alexander** -- Regional Director of Fitness

### Email Pattern
- No public email addresses found; contact via website form
- Email confidence: UNKNOWN

### Pain Signals

**Indeed Employee Reviews -- Scheduling & Billing:**
- "Only paid while training someone, which was 30 minutes at a time, if there was a gap in the schedule you sat around for free." (Source: Indeed)
- "No set work hour schedule" and hours kept "just barely under the full time hour requirement so they didn't have to give benefits." (Source: Indeed)
- "Dealing with angry customers about billing" cited as a challenge. (Source: Indeed)
- Employee suggestion: "Contracts should be a template on the computer with typing in prices and the billing should be in-house." (Source: Indeed) -- this directly indicates manual/outdated billing processes.

**Management Issues:**
- "Manager was so busy flirting with the members and giving them free memberships that he hardly kept up with his employees." (Source: Indeed)
- "Super high turnover rate." (Source: Indeed)
- "No growth movement within company, poor financial structure, limited training for new employees." (Source: Indeed)
- "Poor work life balance." (Source: Indeed)

**Closed Locations:**
- Fitworks Norwood location listed as CLOSED on Yelp, suggesting contraction/operational challenges

### Tech Stack Clues
- Employee reviews suggest outdated/manual billing and contract processes
- Website: fitworks.com (custom CMS)

### Why Ops for Shops
Fitworks is a 30-year-old, locally owned multi-location gym chain with documented operational dysfunction -- manual billing processes, scheduling chaos, high turnover, and at least one closed location. The employee who literally suggested "contracts should be a template on the computer" is telling you their systems are stuck in the past. This is a company that grew organically without investing in operational infrastructure.

**NOTE:** At ~9 locations and potentially 100+ total employees, Fitworks may exceed the sweet spot. The Cincinnati/NKY regional subset (White Oak, West Chester, Florence, Newport) could be the entry point. HQ is in Parma/Cleveland, not Cincinnati -- approach accordingly.

## PROSPECT 4: Nishime Martial Arts
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Nishime Family Karate / Nishime Martial Arts
- **Website:** https://cincinnatimartialarts.com/ (Cincinnati) / https://florencemartialarts.com/ (Florence KY)
- **Phone:** (513) 353-5425
- **Email:** info@cincinnatimartialarts.com (CONFIRMED on website)
- **Location:** 7012 Harrison Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45247 (main); Florence, KY location; formerly 5 locations (Delhi location closed)
- **Type:** Martial arts school (Karate, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu)
- **Founded:** 1973/1986 (Shihan Nishime arrived in Cincinnati 1973; Silverton school est. 1986 -- 40+ years)
- **Employees:** Est. 10-20 (multiple black belt instructors across 2+ locations)
- **Reviews:** 4.8/5 stars with 164 reviews on Birdeye (Cincinnati); 4.6/5 with 32 reviews (Florence)
- **BBB:** Profile exists, not accredited

### Key People
- **Kiyoshi Nishime** -- Founder, Master Instructor, 9th Degree Black Belt. Native of Okinawa, Japan; moved to Cincinnati in 1973
- **Jason Nishime** -- Owner (Delhi location), 4th Degree Black Belt in Karate, Black Belt in BJJ. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/jason-nishime-0b292b103/
- **Mary Beth Nishime** -- President, 3rd Degree Black Belt in Karate, licensed fitness instructor
- **Sensei Drew Canfield** -- 3rd Degree Black Belt, BJJ practitioner since 2010

### Email Pattern
- info@cincinnatimartialarts.com (CONFIRMED)
- Pattern likely: firstname@cincinnatimartialarts.com (INFERRED)

### Pain Signals

**Multi-Generational Family Business Complexity:**
- 50+ year operation now in at least its 2nd generation (Jason Nishime taking ownership roles)
- Previously had 5 locations, now down to ~2 active locations (Delhi location closed per Yelp) -- contraction suggests operational or financial challenges
- Family-run businesses at this scale often lack formalized processes

**No Documented Employee Complaints:**
- Limited public employee review data -- typical for martial arts schools where instructors are often family/long-term students
- The absence of Glassdoor/Indeed data is itself a signal: they likely lack formal HR processes

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: cincinnatimartialarts.com (WordPress-based)
- No visible booking/membership software on website -- likely uses a martial arts management platform (Kicksite, Zen Planner, or similar) but not confirmed
- Contact form on website

### Why Ops for Shops
Nishime is a legacy martial arts institution (50+ years) going through generational transition and location consolidation. Family businesses at this stage desperately need operational formalization -- standardized scheduling, membership management, instructor coordination, and process documentation. The contraction from 5 to 2 locations signals exactly the kind of growing pains that operational improvements can address.

## PROSPECT 5: Jorge Gurgel Martial Arts Academy (JGMMA)
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Jorge Gurgel Martial Arts Academy (JGMMA)
- **Website:** https://www.jgmma.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 443-2048
- **Email:** Contact form on website (GENERIC)
- **Location:** 6875 Fountains Blvd, Ste K, West Chester, OH 45069 (main); 3165 Heritage Green Dr, Monroe, OH 45050 (2nd location)
- **Type:** MMA / Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu / Muay Thai / Boxing / Wrestling
- **Founded:** ~2000 (25+ years)
- **Employees:** Est. 8-15 (owner + multiple coaches/instructors across 2 locations)
- **Reviews:** Positive on Yelp (West Chester and Monroe locations)

### Key People
- **Jorge Gurgel** -- Founder & Owner. Retired UFC fighter, contestant on The Ultimate Fighter 2, 5th Degree BJJ Black Belt. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/jorge-gurgel-b46b6156/. Also serves as official UFC interpreter for Portuguese/Spanish-speaking fighters.

### Email Pattern
- Contact form only; no public email
- Email confidence: UNKNOWN -- likely jorge@ or info@jgmma.com (INFERRED)

### Pain Signals

**Celebrity Owner / Operator Tension:**
- Jorge Gurgel still works as a UFC interpreter at pay-per-view events + runs 2 gym locations + coaches classes. This is a classic stretched-thin owner who would benefit from operational systems that reduce his personal involvement in day-to-day logistics.

**Multi-Location with Active Class Schedule:**
- Two locations with full class schedules (BJJ, Muay Thai, Boxing, Wrestling, MMA, kids programs) require significant coordination
- High-profile training facility (trained UFC fighters like Rich Franklin) adds complexity

**Limited Online Presence for Operations:**
- No visible membership management or booking system on website -- classes appear to be managed informally

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: jgmma.com (appears custom/Squarespace-like)
- No visible online booking or membership management system
- Contact via form only

### Why Ops for Shops
JGMMA is a 2-location martial arts academy run by a celebrity owner who is clearly stretched thin between coaching, UFC interpreter duties, and running two gyms. The lack of visible operational technology and the multi-location class scheduling complexity make this a strong candidate for ops improvement. The owner's personal brand could also benefit from systems that free him to focus on high-value coaching rather than logistics.

## PROSPECT 6: Cincinnati Strength (CrossFit Steel Place)
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Cincinnati Strength / CrossFit Steel Place
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatistrength.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 429-4382
- **Email:** stephenflamm@gmail.com (owner, CONFIRMED from CrossFit Games profile)
- **Location:** 4575 Steel Place, Cincinnati, OH 45209 (Oakley)
- **Type:** CrossFit affiliate / strength & conditioning
- **Founded:** 2008 (18 years; "Greater Cincinnati's Original CrossFit" -- actually CrossFit Steel Place affiliate #599)
- **Employees:** 8 coaches listed (Stephen Flamm, Chelsea McCarty, Jessie Heikenfeld, Ryan Kidd, Kelsey Blaze, Maddy Blaydes, Lucas Gerotto, Nick Coy)
- **Facility:** 7,200 sq ft

### Key People
- **Stephen Flamm** -- Owner/Head Coach. CrossFit Games athlete. Email: stephenflamm@gmail.com

### Email Pattern
- stephenflamm@gmail.com (owner, CONFIRMED)
- No business domain email visible

### Pain Signals

**Single Location, 8 Coaches:**
- Managing 8 coaches' schedules, programming, and member experience in a single 7,200 sq ft facility
- Long-running (18 years) -- likely has accumulated operational debt

**Owner Still Uses Gmail:**
- The fact that the owner's contact is a personal Gmail rather than a business domain email suggests limited investment in business infrastructure

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: cincinnatistrength.com (custom/WordPress)
- Likely uses CrossFit-standard software (Wodify, SugarWOD, or Zen Planner) but not confirmed

### Why Ops for Shops
Cincinnati Strength is one of the oldest CrossFit affiliates in the region (est. 2008) with 8 coaches. The owner using a Gmail address rather than a business email is a red flag for limited operational infrastructure. At 18 years old, the business has likely accumulated significant operational debt that could benefit from systematization.

## PROSPECT 7: Embra Studio
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Embra Studio
- **Website:** https://www.embrastudio.com/
- **Phone:** 513-321-9644
- **Email:** hello@embrastudio.com (CONFIRMED on website)
- **Location:** 3527 Columbia Pkwy, Cincinnati, OH 45226 + 2428 High St, Crescent Springs (Ft. Mitchell), KY 41017
- **Type:** Yoga / Pilates / Barre studio
- **Founded:** Est. 2015-2018 (7-10+ years based on available data)
- **Employees:** Est. 8-15 (multiple instructors across 2 locations)
- **Reviews:** 67 Yelp reviews (Cincinnati location)

### Key People
- **Meredith "Mer" Hogan** -- Owner/Founder. Also founder of The Beauty Way (wellness/ceremony practice). Featured in LINK NKY "Voices of NKY" series.

### Email Pattern
- hello@embrastudio.com (CONFIRMED)
- Pattern likely: firstname@embrastudio.com (INFERRED)

### Pain Signals

**Two Locations Across State Lines:**
- Cincinnati OH + Crescent Springs KY = cross-state scheduling, payroll, and compliance complexity
- Small team managing two studios creates coordination challenges

**Owner Wears Multiple Hats:**
- Meredith Hogan also runs The Beauty Way (separate wellness business) while managing Embra -- classic stretched-thin founder

**Mindbody Integration:**
- Listed on Mindbody (mindbodyonline.com) which suggests they use Mindbody for booking -- a common pain point for small studios due to cost and complexity

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Mindbody:** Listed on Mindbody platform for class booking
- **ClassPass:** Listed on ClassPass
- **Wellhub (formerly Gympass):** Listed partner
- **Website:** embrastudio.com (Squarespace)

### Why Ops for Shops
Embra is a 2-location yoga/Pilates studio spanning Ohio and Kentucky with an owner juggling multiple businesses. Cross-state operations add payroll and compliance complexity. Their use of Mindbody (a common source of frustration for small studios) and presence on multiple booking platforms (ClassPass, Wellhub) creates integration challenges that operational consulting could streamline.

## PROSPECT 8: CrossFit Cincinnati
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** CrossFit Cincinnati
- **Website:** https://www.crossfitcincinnati.com/
- **Phone:** Listed on website
- **Email:** Check website contact page (UNKNOWN)
- **Location:** 8980 Blue Ash Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45242
- **Type:** CrossFit affiliate (Affiliate #799)
- **Founded:** 2007 (19 years -- "Greater Cincinnati's Original CrossFit")
- **Employees:** Est. 6-10 (multiple coaches with CF-L2 certifications, including a Coach/Co-Owner who is an MD)
- **Reviews:** 10 Yelp reviews

### Key People
- **Rainer H.** -- Listed as business owner (Source: Yelp)
- Coach/Co-Owner is an MD with CF-L2 certification (name not confirmed from search results)

### Email Pattern
- Unknown; contact via website
- Email confidence: UNKNOWN

### Pain Signals

**Long-Running Single Location:**
- 19 years at one location -- significant operational history and likely accumulated processes/tech debt
- Multiple coaches with varying certification levels to coordinate

**Limited Online Presence:**
- Only 10 Yelp reviews for a 19-year-old gym suggests limited marketing/digital presence -- may extend to limited operational technology

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: crossfitcincinnati.com (custom)
- Likely uses CrossFit-standard management software

### Why Ops for Shops
CrossFit Cincinnati is one of the oldest affiliates in the region (est. 2007) but has a surprisingly thin digital footprint for its age. A 19-year-old gym that still has minimal online reviews likely has operational systems that have grown organically without intentional design -- a prime candidate for operational improvement.

## PROSPECT 9: Queen City CrossFit
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Queen City CrossFit
- **Website:** https://queencitycrossfit.com/
- **Phone:** Listed on website
- **Email:** Check website (UNKNOWN)
- **Location:** 18 W 7th St, Ste 1, Cincinnati, OH 45202 (Downtown)
- **Type:** CrossFit affiliate (Affiliate #9026)
- **Founded:** 2021 (5 years) -- though some sources suggest earlier origins
- **Employees:** 10 trainers (Source: ZoomInfo)
- **Reviews:** Listed on ClassPass

### Key People
- **Siu Ping Lau** -- Co-Owner (also works at Procter & Gamble)
- **Chad Wieldishofer** -- Co-Owner (also works at Procter & Gamble)
- **Evan Polaski** -- Possibly former owner (referenced in 2015 article, may reflect earlier incarnation or ownership change)

### Email Pattern
- Unknown
- Email confidence: UNKNOWN

### Pain Signals

**Part-Time Owners:**
- Both co-owners work full-time at Procter & Gamble while running the gym -- classic absentee-owner scenario where operational systems need to run without constant owner oversight

**10 Trainers, Downtown Location:**
- Managing 10 trainers' schedules in a downtown location requires coordination systems
- Downtown locations face unique challenges (parking, foot traffic patterns, competitive landscape)

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: queencitycrossfit.com
- Listed on ClassPass

### Why Ops for Shops
Queen City CrossFit has a unique pain point: both owners work full-time at P&G, meaning the gym must essentially run itself during business hours. With 10 trainers to coordinate, this is exactly the scenario where documented processes, automated scheduling, and operational systems become critical. Absentee owners need ops infrastructure more than anyone.

---

## PROSPECT 10: Park's Martial Arts & Fitness
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Park's Martial Arts & Fitness
- **Website:** https://www.parksmartialarts-fitness.com/
- **Phone:** Listed on website
- **Email:** Check website (UNKNOWN)
- **Location:** 8944 Columbia Rd, Loveland, OH (main); at least 1 additional location referenced
- **Type:** Martial arts school (TaeKwonDo, BJJ, Boxing, Wrestling, MMA)
- **Founded:** 1993-1998 (27-33 years; "serving Greater Cincinnati communities for over 30 years")
- **Employees:** Est. 8-15 (Master Park + multiple coaches/instructors)

### Key People
- **Master Park** -- Owner/Head Instructor. Personally guides students through training programs.

### Email Pattern
- Unknown
- Email confidence: UNKNOWN

### Pain Signals

**30+ Year Legacy Business:**
- Long-running family martial arts school with multiple programs (TaeKwonDo, BJJ, Boxing, Wrestling, MMA) across age groups (kids 3+, teens, adults)
- Legacy businesses at this age often have deeply entrenched but informal processes

**Multiple Disciplines = Scheduling Complexity:**
- Unlike single-discipline schools, Park's offers 5+ martial arts disciplines plus fitness programs, each with different instructor requirements and scheduling needs

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: parksmartialarts-fitness.com
- Also listed on WellnessLiving platform (suggests possible use of WellnessLiving for booking/management)
- Listed on KidsFirstSports.com

### Why Ops for Shops
Park's is a 30+ year martial arts institution offering 5+ disciplines across multiple age groups. The scheduling complexity of coordinating different martial arts programs (each requiring specialized instructors) with kids, teens, and adult classes is significant. Legacy businesses at this age typically have processes that "just happened" rather than being designed -- ripe for operational improvement.

## PROSPECT 11: Calibrated CrossFit
**Priority: 3-LOW**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Calibrated CrossFit
- **Website:** https://www.calibratedcrossfit.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 309-8458
- **Email:** arjuna@calibratedcrossfit.com (owner, CONFIRMED)
- **Location:** 673 Wilmer Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45226
- **Type:** CrossFit affiliate (Affiliate #4150)
- **Founded:** Est. 2012-2015 (10+ years)
- **Employees:** Est. 5-8 (owner/coach Arjuna Smith + co-owner Dr. Brittany Smith + additional coaches)

### Key People
- **Arjuna Smith** -- Owner/Coach. 20+ years personal and group programming experience. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/arjuna-smith-675b8810b/. CrossFit Games competitor.
- **Dr. Brittany Smith** -- Co-Owner/Coach

### Email Pattern
- arjuna@calibratedcrossfit.com (CONFIRMED)
- Pattern: firstname@calibratedcrossfit.com

### Pain Signals
- Limited public data on operational pain points
- Small team at single location -- may be too small for Ops for Shops sweet spot
- Husband-wife ownership team is common in CrossFit and can create unique management dynamics

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: calibratedcrossfit.com (custom/WordPress)
- Listed on ClassPass

### Why Ops for Shops
Calibrated is a well-established single-location CrossFit box with a small team. While they may be on the smaller end of the target range, owner Arjuna Smith's 20+ years of experience suggests the gym has matured past startup phase and may be ready for operational professionalization. Lower priority due to small size and lack of documented pain signals.

---

## PROSPECT 12: Cincinnati Fitness & Boxing
**Priority: 3-LOW**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Cincinnati Fitness & Boxing (CFB)
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatifitnessboxing.com/
- **Phone:** Listed on website
- **Email:** Check website (UNKNOWN)
- **Location:** 2929 Spring Grove Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45225 (Camp Washington)
- **Type:** Boxing gym / fitness studio
- **Founded:** 2009 (17 years)
- **Employees:** Est. 5-10
- **Reviews:** 10 Yelp reviews

### Key People
- **Jeff Perry** -- Owner/Founder. Established CFB in 2009 with the goal of creating an authentic boxing gym accessible to everyone.

### Email Pattern
- Unknown
- Email confidence: UNKNOWN

### Pain Signals
- Limited public data
- Single location, small team
- 17 years in business at same location suggests stability but potentially stagnant operations

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: cincinnatifitnessboxing.com

### Why Ops for Shops
CFB is a long-running independent boxing gym with a passionate founder. At 17 years old with a single location, the operations may be deeply founder-dependent. Lower priority due to likely small team size and limited documented pain signals.

## Key Observations
1. **Fitness/gym vertical has fewer mid-size independents** than trades verticals. Most gyms are either national chains or very small (<5 employee) boutique studios. The sweet spot of 10-50 employees is occupied by a handful of multi-location operators.
2. **Body Alive Fitness is the standout prospect** -- 64 employees, 6 locations, $6M revenue, and a catastrophic 2.0 Glassdoor rating with specific quotes about disorganization and management failures.
3. **Cincinnati Sports Club is the largest prospect** but may exceed the 80-employee ceiling. The new CEO (April 2025) creates a natural conversation-starter.
4. **Martial arts schools** (Nishime, JGMMA, Park's) represent an underserved niche -- legacy businesses with complex scheduling needs and minimal technology adoption.
5. **CrossFit boxes** tend to be small (5-10 people) but have strong community cultures and owner-operators who are stretched thin between coaching and business management.
6. **Employee review data is thin** for most fitness businesses except Body Alive and Cincinnati Sports Club. Martial arts schools and CrossFit boxes rarely appear on Glassdoor/Indeed.
7. **Queen City CrossFit's P&G-employed owners** represent a unique angle -- corporate professionals who understand process improvement but may not have applied it to their own gym.

### Key People
- **Gregory T. Hyland** -- President (since 1981). Licensed Master Electrician with 50+ years of experience. Runs a personal WordPress blog at greghyland.net. The classic Reluctant Operator -- master of his craft, running the business for 40+ years.
- **Gil Hyland** -- General Manager / Business Development. Oversees operational efficiency and project execution. Responsible for workforce development, marketing, account management, and customer relations. Email pattern: g***@cooper-electric.net (ZoomInfo).
- **Brian B Brinker** -- Service Manager. Handles service coordination and dispatching. Referenced in customer reviews as the person who answers calls and schedules service. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/brian-b-brinker-01116991/
- **Ted Wright** -- Project Manager & Estimator. Licensed Journeyman Electrician with 30 years experience, with Cooper Electric since 1989. Email pattern: t***@cooper-electric.net (ZoomInfo).

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @cooper-electric.net
- Pattern: FirstInitialLast@cooper-electric.net (68% per RocketReach), e.g., ghyland@cooper-electric.net
- Also: first@cooper-electric.net pattern observed
- Greg Hyland: ghyland@cooper-electric.net (INFERRED -- 68% pattern match)
- Gil Hyland: ghyland@cooper-electric.net or gilh@cooper-electric.net (INFERRED)
- No generic info@ email found publicly. Contact form on website.

### Pain Signals

**Glassdoor Employee Reviews (3.1/5.0 stars, 49 reviews -- only 55% recommend):**
- **"They lied about job functions and hours. No work life balance and no support from upper management."**
- **"They act like they care but they really do not. They talk a good game but don't keep their word."**
- **"Work us like dogs and give 3% raises."**
- Employees rated career opportunities only 2.9/5.0
- Cons most mentioned: work-life balance, culture, senior leadership
- 45% have a positive outlook (meaning 55% do NOT)

**Yelp Customer Reviews (mixed among 51 reviews):**
- **"I've called 8x and they always seem to give the run around and say they will call back with some answers but never do."** (communication/follow-up failure)
- **"Terrible service. Two out of three employees were very rude and unprofessional."**
- **"Scheduling can be a challenge & I am flexible because I can be, but it pays to be patient."** (scheduling issues acknowledged by even satisfied customers)
- **"Cooper is overpriced and incompetent."**
- Positive counterpoint: **"Called Cooper this morning. Spoke to Brian and this afternoon my fixture is repaired!"** -- Brian Brinker (Service Mgr) is clearly the person holding service dispatch together.

**Overall pattern:** Classic owner-bottleneck company. Greg Hyland has run the company since 1981 but employee reviews suggest broken promises, overwork, and lack of process. Customer reviews show communication breakdowns (unreturned calls) alongside praise for individual staff. Brian Brinker appears to be a single point of failure for service coordination.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Website:** WordPress (cooper-electric.net), basic brochure site with contact form
- **Owner's personal blog:** greghyland.net hosted on free WordPress.com -- strong signal of minimal tech investment
- **Email domain:** cooper-electric.net (self-hosted, not ISP email -- but not a modern platform)
- **No evidence of ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber, or any field service management software**
- **No mobile app or online booking/scheduling**
- **"Phones are answered 24 hours a day by Real People"** -- manual phone answering, no automated dispatch
- **PPP loan through North Side Bank and Trust** -- small community bank, not a tech-forward financial relationship

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Cooper Electric is the textbook Ops for Shops target: a 78-year-old family business with ~28 employees, a long-tenured owner-operator (Greg Hyland, president since 1981), and clear operational cracks showing through employee and customer reviews. The Glassdoor data (3.1 stars, 55% would NOT recommend) reveals internal process breakdowns -- broken promises to employees, poor work-life balance, and leadership disconnection. Customer reviews show communication failures (unreturned calls 8x) alongside scheduling challenges. The tech stack is minimal: a basic WordPress site, a free WordPress.com blog for the owner, and manual phone answering. There is no evidence of any field service management platform. Service Manager Brian Brinker appears to be the single operational linchpin. This is a company that built its reputation on craftsmanship and is now straining under the weight of managing 28 people with what appear to be informal, owner-dependent processes.

## PROSPECT 2: Premiere Electric (dba Northern Kentucky Electrical Contractors)
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Premiere Electric (dba Northern Kentucky Electrical Contractors)
- **Website:** https://www.premiereelectriccompany.com/
- **Phone:** (859) 635-2376
- **Location:** 6159 Cabin Creek East Drive, Cold Spring, KY 41076
- **Founded:** January 1990 (36 years in business; incorporated 10/1/1996)
- **Employees:** ~6 (referenced as approximately 6 at this location; PPP loan of $30,091 suggests a small team)
- **Revenue:** ~$600K-$1.2M estimated (based on employee count and PPP loan size)
- **Service Area:** Northern Kentucky, Cincinnati OH, and Indiana tri-state area
- **Services:** Residential electrical service and repair; EV home charging station installation; lighting, outlets, panel upgrades, ceiling fans, whole house rewiring
- **BBB:** Accredited since 12/13/2001, A+ rating
- **NKY Chamber of Commerce member**
- **Licensed in OH, KY, and IN**

### Key People
- **Tom Baynum** -- Owner, Master Electrician. Started in the electrical field in 1987 (38+ years experience). Started the business in January 1990. Manages day-to-day operations, provides leadership, and drives operational performance. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/tom-baynum-00985634/. Writes blog posts on the company website ("The Electricians Corner"). Classic Reluctant Operator.
- **Jamie** -- Vice President & Co-Owner. 29 years experience in the electrical trade. Described as "the administrative backbone of the company's operations" -- handles data entry and supports the team. This is the Backbone persona.
- **Team members referenced by first name on website:** Tanner (10 years experience), Logan (8 years), Phillips (24 years). All employees have background checks.

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @premiereelec.com (per RocketReach: t******@premiereelec.com for Tom Baynum)
- Tom Baynum: tom@premiereelec.com or tbaynum@premiereelec.com (INFERRED from RocketReach partial)
- No generic info@ email publicly listed. Contact through phone or website form.

### Pain Signals

**Structural/Operational Signals:**
- **Owner = operator = sales = estimator.** Tom manages day-to-day operations, provides leadership, and drives performance -- doing everything.
- **"Texted Tom in the morning and he had someone out for an estimate later that day and installed my EV outlet the next day."** (HomeAdvisor review) -- Customers text the owner's personal phone for service. No dispatcher, no CRM, no intake process.
- **"Tom and his crew did an awesome job wiring our new house."** -- Owner is still in the field doing work alongside the crew.
- Jamie (VP/Co-Owner) is described as doing "data entry" -- manual administrative processes, not automated workflows.
- **No Glassdoor or Indeed reviews found** -- too small for employee review platforms, which itself signals an informal operation.
- PPP loan of only $30,091 for ~6 employees suggests very tight margins and no operational buffer.

**HomeAdvisor Reviews:**
- **"They were timely in their response to my request, and in scheduling a service appointment to complete the job."** -- positive, but note: scheduling goes directly through the owner.
- **"The service was very prompt and professional, though I thought the fee was a bit high."** -- potential pricing/estimating inconsistency.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Website:** premiereelectriccompany.com -- a modern-looking site (appears to be HubSpot-hosted based on blog URL structure /blog/author/tom-baynum?hsLang=en)
- **Blog:** Tom writes "The Electricians Corner" blog -- HubSpot CMS likely in use for marketing, which is more sophisticated than expected for this size
- **No evidence of field service management software (ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber)**
- **Customers text the owner's personal phone** -- no dedicated business number system or dispatch platform
- **Jamie does manual data entry** -- no automated invoicing or job management
- **NKY Chamber membership** suggests traditional networking, not digital marketing sophistication
- **NOTE:** The HubSpot website is a positive sign for marketing awareness but does NOT indicate operational sophistication. Many small businesses have modern websites but still run operations on paper, texts, and QuickBooks.

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Premiere Electric is a 36-year-old, owner-dependent operation where Tom Baynum is clearly the bottleneck -- he answers customer texts directly, goes out on jobs, manages operations, and writes the blog. The VP/Co-Owner Jamie handles data entry manually. With approximately 6 employees and $30K in PPP loans, this is a lean operation with no room for operational inefficiency. The fact that there are no employee reviews on Glassdoor or Indeed (too small to register) actually strengthens the case: this is a company that runs entirely on the owner's personal bandwidth. Their website is more polished than expected (HubSpot), which suggests they understand the value of professional presentation but likely have not invested in back-office operations tools. The combination of owner-as-dispatcher, manual data entry, and customer-texts-the-owner is precisely the operational pain that Ops for Shops addresses. NOTE: At ~6 employees, they're at the low end of the target range. They qualify but may have limited budget. Best approached as a quick-win engagement.

## PROSPECT 3: Echler Electric
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Echler Electric, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.echlerelectric.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 608-5740
- **Email:** info@echlerelectric.com (GENERIC - from public listings)
- **Location:** 5141 Globe Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45212
- **Founded:** January 1, 2005 (20+ years in business)
- **Employees:** ~1-4 (Manta estimate); owner + small crew. Website says "big enough to meet your need in a timely fashion, but small enough to keep our service personal & prices affordable."
- **Revenue:** ~$500K-$1M estimated (Manta)
- **Service Area:** Southwestern Ohio and Northern Kentucky
- **Services:** Residential and commercial electrical work, service panel rewiring, standby generators, surge protection, data & network cabling, home automation
- **BBB:** Accredited since 5/13/2015
- **IEC Membership:** Member of Independent Electrical Contractors of Greater Cincinnati
- **BuildZoom Score:** 98 (top 16% of 52,717 Ohio licensed contractors)

### Key People
- **John Echler** -- President & Owner. Every call goes directly to the owner. 50+ years combined team experience. Email: john@echlerelectric.com (CONFIRMED via Blue Book / public listings)
- No other named employees found publicly. This is a sole-proprietor-with-crew operation.

### Email Pattern
- john@echlerelectric.com (CONFIRMED - owner direct)
- info@echlerelectric.com (GENERIC - listed on directories)

### Pain Signals

**Structural/Operational Signals:**
- **"Every call to Echler Electric goes directly to the owner."** (from website/directories) -- Zero dispatch layer. Owner IS the phone system.
- **"The owner is a little hard to reach."** (customer review) -- Direct consequence of owner-as-everything model. When John is on a job, the phone doesn't get answered.
- **"John came and gave a quote and work was scheduled in a timely manner."** -- Owner does estimates personally.
- **Website has a page literally titled "new-page"** (https://www.echlerelectric.com/new-page for Data & Network Cabling) -- unfinished/unprofessional web presence despite using Squarespace.
- 20 years in business with only 1-4 employees suggests deliberate small scale OR inability to operationalize growth.
- Old Squarespace staging URL still visible: john-echler.squarespace.com -- owner built the website himself.

**Customer Reviews (4.78/5.0 average, 25 ratings):**
- **"Very responsive, came out quickly and explained in depth what needed to be done and answered all of my questions thoroughly."** -- Excellent service quality but entirely owner-delivered.
- Reviews consistently praise John personally, with no mention of any other team member by name. Single point of delivery AND management.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Website:** Squarespace (confirmed by john-echler.squarespace.com staging URL and BuiltWith data: NS1, Squarespace Online Stores, Adobe Typekit)
- **Email:** Microsoft 365 (detected on website)
- **Owner-built website** with unfinished pages (new-page slug for cabling services)
- **No evidence of field service management software**
- **No online scheduling or booking**
- **Phone goes directly to owner** -- no automated routing, no answering service, no dispatcher

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Echler Electric represents the pure Reluctant Operator archetype: John Echler has been a master electrician for 20+ years, does excellent work (4.78 stars, BuildZoom top 16%), but runs the entire business through his personal phone. The customer feedback that he's "a little hard to reach" is the direct symptom of an owner who is simultaneously the electrician, the estimator, the project manager, the dispatcher, and the bookkeeper. His Squarespace site (self-built, with unfinished pages) signals minimal tech investment. At 1-4 employees, he's at the very bottom of the target range and may be a sole proprietor with occasional helpers rather than a company with employees. **NOTE: Echler may be too small for a full engagement. Best approached as a micro-client or referral source. Priority is MEDIUM because of size constraints, but the pain signals are textbook.**

## PROSPECT 4: Hayes Electric Services
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Hayes Electric Services, Inc.
- **Website:** https://hayeselectricservices.com/
- **Phone:** (859) 982-8802
- **Email:** keith@hayeselectricservices.com (CONFIRMED - owner, from website/directories)
- **Location:** 9757 Whispering Way, Alexandria, KY 41001
- **Founded:** 2010 (16 years in business; Keith Hayes has been in the trade since 1995)
- **Employees:** ~5-15 estimated (owner-operated, growing; exact count not publicly available)
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available
- **Service Area:** Northern Kentucky and Greater Cincinnati, OH
- **Services:** Residential and commercial electrical; service upgrades, troubleshooting/repair, ceiling fans, whole house surge suppression, generators, computer networks, phone/cable TV, home theater, landscape lighting, underground wiring, low voltage lighting and dimming systems
- **BBB:** Listed but NOT accredited; insufficient info for BBB rating
- **LinkedIn:** linkedin.com/company/hayes-electric-services-inc-

### Key People
- **Keith Hayes** -- President & Owner. Master Electrician since 1995 (30+ years in the trade). Started Hayes Electric Services in 2010. Owner-operated business. Email: keith@hayeselectricservices.com (CONFIRMED from public listings).
- No other named employees found publicly.

### Email Pattern
- keith@hayeselectricservices.com (CONFIRMED - owner direct)
- No generic info@ email listed. Contact via phone or website.

### Pain Signals

**Structural/Operational Signals:**
- **"Owner-operated company"** -- stated directly on their website. Keith is the owner AND the operator.
- **BBB lists insufficient information to rate** -- could signal a thin business infrastructure, minimal formalized processes, or simply that they haven't invested in BBB accreditation.
- Website is basic/functional -- standard small contractor site.
- Company is 16 years old but has no public employee review data (Indeed, Glassdoor) -- too small for those platforms, suggesting it remains a small, informal operation.
- **The service list is extremely broad** (electrical + computer networks + phone/cable TV + home theater + landscape lighting) -- a wide spread of services for what appears to be a very small team suggests an owner saying yes to everything, which is an operational scaling challenge.

**Customer Reviews (overwhelmingly positive):**
- **"Scheduling was easy, there were no hidden costs or fees, and they were all very professional."** (Angi)
- **"Very reasonable price, great communication, and prompt service."** (Yelp)
- **"They got the job scheduled right away and the work was done on time and as promised, with charges slightly less than other quotes received."** (Angi)
- Reviews are positive but sparse (11 on Yelp), consistent with a small operation.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Website:** Basic/template contractor website at hayeselectricservices.com. Not Squarespace, WordPress, or Wix -- appears to be a basic hosted site.
- **No evidence of field service management software**
- **No online scheduling or booking capability**
- **Owner's personal email used for business contact** (keith@hayeselectricservices.com at the business domain, but it's a first-name@ format, not a role-based address)
- **No app, no customer portal, no automated communication**

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Hayes Electric is a 16-year-old, owner-operated NKY electrical contractor where Keith Hayes IS the business. The company has grown enough to have a team (references to "they" and crew in reviews) but not enough to have any public operational infrastructure. The extremely broad service offering (from basic electrical to home theater to computer networks) suggests an owner who says yes to everything -- a hallmark of the Reluctant Operator who hasn't yet built systems to filter, schedule, and manage diverse job types. The BBB's inability to even rate the company suggests minimal formalized business processes. Customer reviews are strong on quality but the sparse volume (11 Yelp reviews in 16 years) signals that growth has been entirely word-of-mouth with no marketing or operational investment. **NOTE: Employee count is unclear -- could be as few as 3-5 or as many as 10-15. Recommend a phone call to qualify before outreach. Priority is MEDIUM pending size confirmation.**

|---|---|---|
| **KEP Electric** | Amelia, OH (Cincinnati area) | Acquired by IES Holdings (Houston, TX) in November 2020. Now PE-owned. 84 employees, $63.7M revenue. Disqualified: PE-owned, too large. |

# RESEARCH NOTES

## IEC of Greater Cincinnati -- Member Directory
The Independent Electrical Contractors of Greater Cincinnati (iec-cincy.com) maintains a member directory of local independent electrical contractors. Both Cooper Electric and Echler Electric are members. This directory is a valuable source for future prospecting in this vertical. Other members not fully researched: Becker Electric, Decker Electric, Frey Electric, Henkel Electric, among others. Worth a deeper sweep if this vertical proves productive.

## Email Verification Recommendations
- Cooper Electric: Call (513) 271-5000 and ask for Greg or Gil Hyland to verify email before cold outreach.
- Premiere Electric: Call (859) 635-2376 and confirm Tom Baynum's email (likely tom@premiereelec.com or tbaynum@premiereelec.com).
- Echler Electric: john@echlerelectric.com is confirmed via multiple public sources. Can send directly.
- Hayes Electric: keith@hayeselectricservices.com is confirmed via multiple public sources. Can send directly.

## Vertical Observations
1. Cincinnati electrical contractors are heavily owner-dependent. Unlike the accounting vertical where firms have managing partners and office managers, these are businesses where the owner IS the dispatcher, estimator, project manager, and often still in the field.
2. The "Backbone" persona (office manager/scheduler) barely exists in this vertical at the smaller end. Only Cooper Electric (Brian Brinker, Service Manager) and Premiere Electric (Jamie, VP/Co-Owner handling admin) have identifiable back-office people.
3. Field service management software adoption appears near-zero among independents in this market. No evidence of ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber, or similar platforms at any of these companies.
4. Pain signals in this vertical show up more in customer reviews (unreturned calls, scheduling delays) and employee reviews (overwork, broken promises) than in BBB complaints.
5. Best entry point for outreach: Cooper Electric is the strongest prospect by far -- right size (28 employees), maximum pain signals (Glassdoor 3.1 stars), clear operational dysfunction, and identifiable people to contact.

## 3. Post Templates

### Person Post

**Purpose:** They remember you, not your service.

```
HOOK (1–2 lines)
Something you believe. A moment that shaped how you think.
The line that makes someone stop scrolling.

STORY / OBSERVATION (3–5 short paragraphs)
What happened. What you saw. What most people miss.
Keep it concrete. No abstraction without a story first.

REFRAME (1–2 lines)
The turn. The thing they didn't expect.
Restate the belief with the weight of the story behind it.

CLOSING LINE
One sentence. Memorable. The thing they'd quote back to you.
```

**LinkedIn:** 150–250 words. Short paragraphs (1–3 sentences). Line breaks between every thought.
**Tone:** Philosopher who builds. Conviction without aggression. First person always.
**CTA:** None, or very soft ("Been thinking about this a lot lately.").

---

### Real Problems Post

**Purpose:** They trust that you understand their world.

```
PAIN POINT HOOK (1–2 lines)
A specific scenario they recognize instantly.
"You're closing the books and the numbers don't match. Again."

WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE (2–3 examples)
The symptoms. What they see day to day.
Use their language — not yours.

WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON (1–2 paragraphs)
The diagnosis. Why this keeps happening.
No jargon. Plain English.

WHAT BETTER LOOKS LIKE (1–2 paragraphs)
Paint the picture without selling yourself into it.
They should think "I want that" before they think "I need him."
```

**LinkedIn:** 150–300 words. Specificity is everything — name the tools, name the scenario.
**Tone:** Peer at the table. You've seen this before. You're not surprised, and you're not judging.
**CTA:** Question ("What's your version of this?") or soft pointer ("This is exactly what the Tune-Up is for.").

---

### Invite Post

**Purpose:** They know exactly how to take the next step.

```
BRIDGE (1–2 lines)
Connect to something from the week.
"I've been talking all week about [theme]. Here's the part where I tell you what I actually do."

WHAT YOU DO (2–3 sentences)
Concrete. No abstraction.
"I look at the software that runs your day, find where things don't line up, and deliver a plan you can act on."

WHO IT'S FOR (1–2 sentences)
Qualify openly. It builds trust.
"If you run a firm with 5–50 people and your tools don't talk to each other, this is for you."

CTA (1–2 lines)
Clear, direct, low-friction.
Link to Calendly, DM invitation, or "reply to this post."
```

**LinkedIn:** 100–200 words. Shorter than the other types. Respect that you're asking for something.
**Tone:** Direct but earned. You've given all week — now you're making an offer.
**CTA rotation:**
- Hard: "Book 30 minutes. Free. No pitch." + Calendly link
- Soft: "DM me if any of this resonated."
- Question: "What's the one thing you'd fix in your business if it didn't cost you a weekend?"

## 4. Platform Adaptation Rules

### LinkedIn (Primary — write this first)

- 150–300 words
- Short paragraphs: 1–3 sentences max, then a line break
- Hook is the first 2 lines (everything before "…see more") — make them count
- No hashtags in the body. 3–5 relevant hashtags at the very bottom.
- No emojis in body copy. A single emoji bullet is okay in a list if it reads clean.
- End with engagement: a question, a statement, or a clear CTA
- Tag people only if you're referencing them specifically

### X (Punch version)

- 280 characters or 2–3 tweet thread
- Same core idea, stripped to the bone
- Lead with the sharpest line from the LinkedIn version
- If threading: first tweet is the hook, last tweet is the CTA or closing line
- Link in reply, not in the main tweet (algorithm penalty)
- No hashtags (they don't help on X anymore)

### Bluesky (Candid version)

- 300 characters or short thread
- Most philosophical, thinking-out-loud version
- This is where you can be the most raw and unpolished
- Works well for questions, half-formed ideas, and "here's what I'm wrestling with"
- Community is smaller and more engaged — respond to every reply

## 5. Social Bee Setup

### Categories (3)

| Category      | Days      | Description |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Person        | Mon, Wed  | Worldview, philosophy, identity posts |
| Real Problems | Tue, Thu  | Pain points, scenarios, case patterns |
| Invite        | Fri       | CTAs, offers, engagement asks |

### Launch Queue (Weeks 1–3)

Load all 15 launch posts (5 per week × 3 platforms each = 45 pieces total) as a **one-time campaign** or **scheduled posts**, not evergreen. These are time-sequenced — they tell a story across 3 weeks and shouldn't recycle.

### Ongoing Queue (Week 4+)

Switch to **evergreen categories**. Each category has its own queue:
- Write 5 core posts per week (batch session)
- Adapt each for 3 platforms = 15 pieces
- Load into the matching Social Bee category
- Social Bee fires the right category on the right day

### Posting Times

Set per platform in Social Bee. Starting points (adjust based on engagement data):
- **LinkedIn:** 7:30–8:30 AM ET (morning commute / desk arrival)
- **X:** 12:00–1:00 PM ET (lunch scroll)
- **Bluesky:** 5:00–6:00 PM ET (evening wind-down)

## 6. Writing Workflow

### Weekly Batch (1 session)

1. **Pick topics** — Check the ongoing schedule (Section 2). What's the Person theme this week? What Real Problem? What's the Invite?
2. **Write 5 LinkedIn posts** — Use the templates (Section 3). Don't overthink. Write fast, edit once.
3. **Adapt for X** — Go through each post. Pull the sharpest line. Compress.
4. **Adapt for Bluesky** — Go through each post. Loosen it up. Think out loud.
5. **Load into Social Bee** — 15 pieces total into 3 categories.
6. **Done.** Move on with your week.

### Pre-publish Checklist

Before scheduling any post, run it through this:

- [ ] First person? ("I" not "we")
- [ ] Would the Backbone read this and feel seen?
- [ ] Would the Reluctant Operator feel like he's talking to a peer?
- [ ] Would either of them feel stupid or sold to? (If yes → rewrite)
- [ ] No banned words? (systems, tech, digital transformation, solutions, leverage, optimize, synergy, stakeholder, deliverables)
- [ ] Hook is strong enough to stop a scroll?
- [ ] Cincinnati mentioned where relevant?
- [ ] CTA matches the post type? (Person=none/soft, Real Problems=question/soft, Invite=direct)

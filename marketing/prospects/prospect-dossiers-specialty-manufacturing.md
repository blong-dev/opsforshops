## PROSPECT 1: DF Electronics, Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Website:** https://dfelectronics.com/
- **Location:** 200 Novner Dr, Cincinnati, OH 45215
- **Founded:** 1974 (52 years in business)
- **Size:** ~75 employees
- **Revenue:** ~$12.2M (Dun & Bradstreet)
- **Services:** Full-service contract electronic manufacturing -- PCB assembly, wire harness, box build, test hardware/software design, manufacturing process optimization, package and panel design
- **Industries Served:** OEMs across OH, KY, IN (central Ohio River corridor) -- industrial, medical, defense

### Key People
- **Laughton Fine** -- President & Treasurer
- **Ann Fine** -- Vice President (accounting, financial reporting, cost accounting)
- **Bruce [last name not confirmed]** -- Quality Assurance Manager (interfaces with customers/vendors on product quality)
- Note: Family-run business (father and brother referenced in org description -- Laughton and Ann coordinate with operations manager who is a family member)

### Contact
- **Phone:** (513) 772-7792
- **Email:** dfemail@dfelectronics.com -- GENERIC (general inbox listed on website)
- **Key contacts page:** dfelectronics.com/key_contacts/ (may have individual emails)

### Pain Signals
- **Indeed review (former employee, ~6 months tenure):** "The place is filthy." Criticized management and noted "No security at all." -- Source: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Df-Electronics/reviews)
- **Indeed review (Woodlawn, OH location):** "Too many politics" and "management is horrible," with concerns about workplace training. -- Source: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Df-Electronics/reviews)
- **BBB:** Not accredited -- Source: [BBB](https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/commercial-manufacturers/df-electronics-inc-0292-36000785)
- **Interpretation:** A 75-person family-run electronics manufacturer founded in 1974 with employee complaints about cleanliness, training, and management politics screams legacy operations. At $12M revenue with 75 employees, margins are tight. Likely running on aging systems with tribal knowledge concentrated in the Fine family.

### Tech Stack
- No public ERP/MRP evidence
- Quality management mentioned (Bruce handles QA) but no ISO certification found publicly
- Design and engineering capabilities suggest some CAD/CAM tooling
- Website is basic/dated -- low digital maturity signal

### Why Ops for Shops
DF Electronics is a classic family-run manufacturer that has survived 50+ years on relationships and craftsmanship but shows signs of operational strain -- employee complaints about training and management suggest undocumented processes and ad-hoc systems. At 75 employees, they are at the painful inflection point where spreadsheets and tribal knowledge break down. Modernizing their production tracking, quoting, and job management would directly address the "politics" and "management" issues employees cite.

## PROSPECT 2: Valley Metal Works, Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Website:** https://valleymetalworks.com
- **Location:** 698 W Columbia Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45215
- **Founded:** 80+ years ago (~1940s)
- **Size:** ~34 employees
- **Services:** Custom metal fabrication, precision laser cutting, sheet and plate rolling, press braking, design assistance and optimization
- **Industries Served:** Small to medium OEMs and ODMs

### Key People
- **Jim Steinbeck** -- Co-Owner
- **Joe Rings** -- Co-Owner
- **Travis Bryant** -- Co-Owner
- (3-owner structure confirmed by employee reviews)

### Contact
- **Phone:** (513) 554-1022
- **Email:** sales@valleymetalworks.com -- GENERIC (sales inbox)
- **Hours:** Mon-Fri 7:00 AM - 3:00 PM

### Pain Signals
- **Indeed review (former employee):** "3 owners constantly fighting against each other with employees caught in the middle... this sinking ship... doesn't invest in needed equipment." -- Source: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Valley-Metal-Works/reviews)
- **Indeed review (another employee):** Criticized the plant manager/supervisor, claiming he "kissed butt to get where he is" with "no real management experience." -- Source: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Valley-Metal-Works/reviews)
- **Indeed overall rating:** 3.5/5 stars (4 reviews), management scored 2.8/5
- **Positive reviews mention:** "Room for advancement, very relaxed environment, managers willing to work with employees and give them a chance."
- **Interpretation:** Three co-owners fighting with employees stuck in the middle is a textbook operational chaos signal. The complaint about not investing in equipment and the "sinking ship" metaphor suggest cash flow pressure and deferred modernization. Management scoring 2.8/5 confirms leadership/process gaps.

### Tech Stack
- No public ERP evidence
- Laser cutting equipment (suggests some CNC capability)
- No ISO or quality certifications found publicly
- Website is modern and professional -- slightly higher digital maturity than peers

### Why Ops for Shops
Valley Metal Works is a 34-person shop with a 3-owner leadership structure that employees describe as dysfunctional. The pain is acute: owners fighting, underinvestment in equipment, and management confusion. A standardized operations platform could give all three owners shared visibility into production, eliminate the "caught in the middle" dynamic by making workflows transparent, and help them make data-driven investment decisions instead of arguing.

## PROSPECT 3: Spectra-Tech Manufacturing, Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Website:** https://4spectra.com/
- **Location:** 4013 Borman Dr, Batavia, OH 45103 (~15 miles east of Cincinnati)
- **Founded:** 1998 (28 years in business)
- **Size:** ~60-84 employees (PPP loan retained 84 jobs; various sources say 30-84)
- **Revenue:** ~$738K PPP loan suggests $8-12M revenue range
- **Services:** Electronic manufacturing services -- PCB assembly, SMT, through-hole, box build, testing, component sourcing
- **Industries Served:** OEMs across multiple sectors

### Key People
- **Scott Reilman** -- President & Owner
- Email pattern: s***@spectratechmfg.com (ZoomInfo, partially redacted)

### Contact
- **Phone:** (513) 735-9300
- **Email (general):** Available via contact form at 4spectra.com/contact/
- **Email (owner):** Likely sreilman@spectratechmfg.com -- INFERRED from ZoomInfo pattern
- **BBB:** Listed but not accredited -- Source: [BBB](https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/batavia/profile/wholesale-electronic-supplies/spectra-tech-manufacturing-inc-0292-13001500)

### Pain Signals
- **Indeed/Glassdoor review:** "Management is awful, ownership is worse, and nepotism abounds. The company cares very little for their employees." -- Source: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Spectra--tech-Manufacturing,-Inc/reviews)
- **Glassdoor review:** "Compensation falls below industry standards with limited financial incentives... career growth is relatively nonexistent." -- Source: [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Spectra-Tech-Reviews-E1864151.htm)
- **Glassdoor review:** "Management frequently played favorites, ignored employee concerns, and micro-managed daily tasks." -- Source: [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Spectra-Tech-Reviews-E1864151.htm)
- **Indeed review:** "Very low pay of $15 an hour for SMT operators, low once-a-year raises, and very little advancement opportunities." -- Source: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Spectra--tech-Manufacturing,-Inc/reviews)
- **Active hiring:** Multiple open positions (Assembler $17/hr, Solderer $16/hr, Test Operator $15.50/hr, Test Technician $20-23/hr) with $500 hiring/retention bonus and $100/month attendance bonus -- signals turnover problems
- **Interpretation:** The attendance bonus alone is a red flag -- you only pay people extra to show up when absenteeism is a problem. Combined with below-market wages, nepotism complaints, and active hiring across multiple roles, this is a company struggling with retention. Micromanagement complaints suggest lack of systems -- managers hovering because there is no production visibility dashboard.

### Tech Stack
- No public ERP/MRP evidence
- SMT line equipment (pick-and-place, reflow)
- Testing capabilities (dedicated test operators/technicians)
- No ISO certification found publicly
- Careers page on website suggests some HR process maturity

### Why Ops for Shops
Spectra-Tech is hemorrhaging employees and paying bonuses just to get people to show up. The micromanagement complaints point directly to a lack of production visibility -- if managers could see job status and throughput on a dashboard, they would not need to hover. Better scheduling, job tracking, and workflow transparency would reduce the chaos that drives turnover, while improved quoting and cost tracking could free up margin to address the below-market compensation that employees universally complain about.

## PROSPECT 4: K&H Industries
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Website:** https://kh-ind.com/
- **Location:** Cincinnati, OH (exact address not confirmed publicly)
- **Founded:** 1905 (121 years in business)
- **Size:** Not confirmed publicly; likely 15-40 employees based on capabilities described
- **Services:** Custom metal stampings, progressive die building, conceptual design, prototyping, engineering assistance, short-run to high-volume production
- **Industries Served:** Automotive, industrial, consumer products
- **Certifications:** ISO 9001:2015

### Key People
- **David Sharkey** -- Production Manager
- **Sharkey family** -- Ownership (family-owned business, specific owner name not confirmed)

### Contact
- **Phone:** Not confirmed from search
- **Email:** Not confirmed; website contact likely available at kh-ind.com
- **Glassdoor:** 3 reviews (content not retrieved)
- **Indeed:** Limited reviews; one mentioned "limited resources and direction for new employees"

### Pain Signals
- **Indeed review:** "Limited resources and direction for new employees" -- Source: [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/K&H-Industries/reviews)
- **Interpretation:** A 121-year-old family stamping shop with ISO 9001 certification shows some process maturity, but the "limited resources and direction" complaint suggests onboarding and training documentation gaps. Being ISO-certified means they have quality processes on paper but may struggle with day-to-day operational tooling.

### Tech Stack
- ISO 9001:2015 certified (documented quality management system)
- Progressive die building (suggests toolroom with design capability)
- No public ERP evidence
- Website is clean but basic

### Why Ops for Shops
K&H is a fascinating prospect -- a 121-year-old ISO-certified stamping house that still apparently lacks resources for onboarding new employees. The ISO certification means they understand process documentation in theory, but the gap between their quality system and their operational tooling is likely where pain lives. A production management platform would complement their ISO processes and address the "limited resources and direction" that new employees experience.

## PROSPECT 5: Powder Coating Specialty, LLC
**Priority: 3-LOW**

### Company Overview
- **Website:** https://powdercoatingspecialty.com/
- **Location:** 9976 Springfield Pike, Cincinnati, OH 45215
- **Founded:** 1998 (per some sources) or 1988 (per others) -- 28-38 years in business
- **Size:** 1-10 employees
- **Services:** Powder coating for commercial and industrial fabrication, sandblasting
- **Industries Served:** Industrial manufacturers, commercial, individual consumers

### Key People
- **Ken Engel** -- Owner
- **Brian [last name not confirmed]** -- Lead technician/team member (referenced in reviews)

### Contact
- **Phone:** (513) 353-2378
- **Email:** Contact form on website (no direct email found) -- GENERIC
- **Hours:** 7:00 AM - 4:00 PM
- **BBB:** Listed, not accredited

### Pain Signals
- **No negative reviews found** -- Customer reviews are universally positive
- **Yelp/Google reviews:** "Brian and his team of coworkers do fantastic work at a reasonable cost. Highly recommend." -- Source: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/biz/powder-coating-specialty-cincinnati)
- **Review:** Work "turned out great and was completed in less than half the time." -- Source: powdercoatingspecialty.com/reviews/
- **Interpretation:** Small, well-run shop with happy customers. At 1-10 employees, they may be too small for significant operational pain, but the owner is likely wearing every hat -- quoting, scheduling, invoicing, purchasing, and coating.

### Tech Stack
- No public evidence of any business software
- Website is professional but simple
- Very low digital maturity likely

### Why Ops for Shops
Powder Coating Specialty is a well-regarded micro-shop where Ken Engel is almost certainly doing everything himself -- quoting jobs, scheduling the line, ordering powder, invoicing customers, and managing Brian's team. At this size, the pain is not operational complexity but owner burnout and the inability to scale. A simple job tracking and invoicing system could free Ken from administrative burden and help him take on more work without hiring office staff. Lower priority due to small size and likely limited budget.

## DISQUALIFIED COMPANIES

| Company | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Monnig Welding Co.** | Too small (~5 employees, ~$300K revenue). 5th-generation family business but essentially a micro-shop. Below minimum viable size for Ops for Shops engagement. |
| **Metal Technology Systems (MTS)** | Too small (1-10 employees per Explorium). Single-owner shop (Steve Williams). Similar to Powder Coating Specialty but with even less public presence. |
| **Toolcraft Products, Inc.** | Founded 1939 but insufficient public data to confirm independence, size, or ownership. Could not verify not PE-owned or subsidiary. |
| **Marschall Welding & Fabrication** | Established 2019 -- only ~7 years old and likely very small. Insufficient operating history and scale. |
| **Cincinnati Mobile Welding & Fabrication** | Mobile operation, not a manufacturing facility. Different business model. |
| **Commander Coatings** | Family-operated but insufficient data on size, ownership details, or operational pain signals. |
| **Epoxy Systems Blasting & Coating** | Private, 20+ year business in Cleves, OH but no employee count, ownership, or review data found. |
| **Independent Sheet Metal** | Veteran-owned Ohio custom fab shop but could not confirm Cincinnati metro location or employee count. |
| **Modern Sheet Metal Works** | Founded 1936 but website is dated (http only) and insufficient data to qualify. Worth revisiting. |
| **Powder Kote Industries (PKI)** | 50+ years in business but no ownership, size, or review data found to qualify. Worth revisiting. |
| **K&H Industries** was borderline on data -- promoted to Prospect 4 based on ISO certification, 121-year history, and Sharkey family ownership confirmation, but employee count remains unconfirmed. |

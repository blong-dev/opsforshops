# ACCOUNTING FIRMS

## Priority 1 (Strongest Pain Signals)

### Flagel Huber Flagel (FHF)
- **Website:** https://fhf-cpa.com/
- **Size:** ~50 employees, 30+ CPAs
- **Founded:** 1933
- **Key People:** Randy Kuvin (former Managing Partner, stepped down 2023); Kevin Behrle (likely current leadership)
- **Tech Stack:** Offers IT services as a service line. No specific software advertised.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor review explicitly states: **"The firm is behind in the times, trying to catch up but essentially dust in the wind."**
  - "Internal communication has been an issue"
  - "Work needs to be more evenly spread around to staff"
  - "Additional staffing is definitely necessary"
  - Hiring administrative staff for both Dayton and Cincinnati offices
  - Managing Partner transition (Kuvin stepped down 2023) — new leadership still finding footing
- **Why:** 90+ year old firm. Employees themselves are calling out the technology gap. Uneven workload distribution suggests workflow/process problems. Three office locations (Dayton, Cincinnati, Troy) mean coordination challenges. This is the strongest pain signal in the entire accounting list.

### Burke CPAs & Advisors
- **Website:** https://burkecpa.com/
- **Size:** ~33-47 employees, 18 CPAs, 3 partners
- **Founded:** 1984
- **Key People:** Patrick Burke (Managing Partner/Founder); Jake Burke (Partner, son); Pam Conner (Partner); Lauren (hired 2024 as Administrative Assistant for data entry, filing, electronic records)
- **Tech Stack:** No specific software mentioned publicly.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor Cincinnati employees rate compensation 3.0/5: **"low, low pay for monotonous, grueling job"**
  - Work-life balance rated 3.5/5, career advancement 3.2/5
  - Only 55% of Cincinnati employees would recommend
  - Reviews mention "monotonous" work and employees leaving/being re-hired for better pay
  - Recently hired admin specifically for data entry and filing
  - Also hiring Accounting & Assurance Manager ($115K+)
- **Why:** Clear operational pain: manual data entry, filing, records management. Employee dissatisfaction with monotonous work = ripe for automation. Family-run firm where the founding partner may be open to modernizing. The admin hire signals they are trying to throw bodies at a process problem.

### Kirsch CPA Group
- **Website:** https://kirschcpa.com/
- **Size:** ~20-30 employees (ESOP, employee-owned since 2024)
- **Founded:** 1991
- **Key People:** Pete Abner (CEO, former partner, now leads post-ESOP); John Kirsch (Founder); Diane Glover (Director of Practice Growth — marketing, biz dev, recruiting)
- **Tech Stack:** QuickBooks Training & Consulting offered as a service line. Website mentions "strengthening traditional service offering with technology."
- **Pain Signals:**
  - ESOP transition in 2024 is a major organizational change — ownership transitions frequently trigger process/systems upheaval
  - Glassdoor (4.3/5) notes tax season stress
  - Actively hiring Tax Managers
  - Diane Glover's recruiting-focused role suggests talent acquisition is a pain point
- **Why:** Mid-transition firm. ESOP means new leadership (Pete Abner) is making decisions the founder previously made. Operational modernization is likely top of mind. Employee-owned firms have a financial incentive to improve efficiency.

## Priority 2

### Rudler, PSC
- **Website:** https://rudler.cpa/
- **Size:** ~58 employees + 7 remote (13% employee growth in 2024)
- **Founded:** ~1970s (50+ years)
- **Key People:** Alex Weidner (President); Tami Lawson (COO); Greg Lamping, David Neuhaus (Shareholders)
- **Tech Stack:** Rightworks AI, ChatGPT, Blue J for financial statement analysis. QuickBooks ProAdvisor. First firm of its size to go paperless. Cloud-first. Dedicated Technology Coordinator. Process Improvement Team (PIT) meets every 3 weeks. Won "2019 Best Accounting Firm for Technology."
- **Pain Signals:**
  - PIT team and Technology Coordinator = actively managing growing pains
  - 13% headcount growth in one year = onboarding and process scaling challenges
  - Hit $10M revenue milestone Dec 2024 — growth inflection points strain existing systems
  - Multiple offices expanding (Ft. Wright)
- **Why:** Most tech-savvy firm on the list — they already buy technology solutions. Rapid growth means budget and appetite. COO Tami Lawson is the operational decision maker. Approach from a "scale your processes" angle.

### Hebbeler & Weickert CPAs
- **Website:** https://hwcpa513.com/
- **Size:** ~5-10 employees
- **Founded:** 1984
- **Key People:** Robert Hebbeler (Co-Owner); Phillip Weickert (Co-Owner); Steven Goldman (Owner); **Erin Hart (Office Manager)**; Brandy Markley, Yassine Slimani (staff)
- **Tech Stack:** QuickBooks, Gusto (payroll partner), Microsoft 365
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Gusto payroll partner processing payroll for clients = integration friction with QuickBooks
  - Small team with identified Office Manager (Erin Hart) — likely overwhelmed juggling admin, client communication, ops
  - Multi-owner structure (3 owners) can create decision-making complexity
- **Why:** Known tech stack (QuickBooks + Gusto + M365) makes it easy to tailor a pitch. Gusto/QuickBooks integration pain is well-documented in the industry. Erin Hart is the "Backbone" persona from your voice doc.

## Priority 3

### Seibel & Katz CPAs
- **Website:** https://www.seibelkatzcpa.com/
- **Size:** ~6 employees
- **Key People:** Robert W. Seibel (Bob, President, MBA from Xavier, former controller for 12 years); John Rothgeb (Managing Partner)
- **Tech Stack:** QuickBooks (dedicated page). Serves healthcare, construction, restaurants, real estate.
- **Why:** Bob's controller background means he understands operations and systems — he'll "get" an efficiency pitch faster than a pure tax practitioner. Small enough that one conversation reaches the decision maker.

### Brauning & Company, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.brauningcpa.com/
- **Size:** ~5-10 employees
- **Key People:** Don Brauning (Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** QuickBooks (multiple website pages dedicated to it). Payroll, Part-Time CFO Services.
- **Why:** Single decision maker. QuickBooks-heavy practice with operational services (payroll, CFO, cash flow) = plenty of repetitive workflows. Relatively young firm (2012) in Blue Ash — likely more open to modern tools.

### Franz CPAs, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.franzcpas.com/
- **Size:** ~9-10 employees
- **Key People:** Edward L. Soergel and Anthony J. Borgerding (Owners since Oct 2019, purchased from Timothy Franz)
- **Tech Stack:** Certified QuickBooks ProAdvisors. Serves clients in all 50 states from Cincinnati.
- **Why:** New ownership (2019) of an old firm (1967) = "inherited legacy systems" scenario. 10-person team serving 50 states = enormous coordination needs relative to headcount.

### Longschaefer & Company (LSC)
- **Website:** https://www.lsc.cpa/
- **Size:** ~18 employees
- **Key People:** Ronald A. Long (President/Co-Founder); Michael W. Long (Managing Partner); Ronald W. Schaefer (Partner/Co-Founder, 45 years experience)
- **Tech Stack:** AWS, Cloudflare CDN, WordPress, Microsoft 365
- **Why:** Succession planning likely on the horizon. Michael Long being groomed (Managing Partner while father is President). When firms plan succession, they need to systematize processes currently in partners' heads.

### Leverone & Associates
- **Website:** https://www.leveronecpa.com/
- **Size:** ~6-10 employees
- **Key People:** Francine Taggart (Owner/CPA)
- **Pain Signals:** Three offices with 6-10 employees = staff spread thin. Mixed reviews on accuracy suggest process/quality control gaps. $1.1M revenue with ~9 employees = tight margins.
- **Why:** Multi-location with tiny headcount = operational strain. Francine Taggart is likely both practitioner and ops person — she'd feel the pain most acutely.

### Atlas CPAs & Advisors PLLC
- **Website:** https://atlasfirms.com/
- **Size:** ~10-25 in Cincinnati (25 offices across 8 states)
- **Key People:** Loni Woodley (Managing Partner); Ben Holscher (Partner, promoted 2025)
- **Why:** Ben Holscher is a newly minted Cincinnati partner building his book — may welcome tools that help him scale.

### Disqualified Firms
- **Flynn & Company** — Merged into UHY (national) mid-2025
- **VonLehman CPA** — Merged with Dean Dorton Jan 2024 (~550 employees)
- **Cassady Schiller** — Acquired by KSM (Top 60 national) May 2024
- **Clark Schaefer Hackett** — 600+ employees, too large

# REAL ESTATE BROKERAGES

## Priority 1

### Comey & Shepherd Realtors
- **Website:** https://www.comey.com
- **Size:** ~180 agents, multiple offices
- **Founded:** 1946
- **Key People:** Scott Nelson (CEO since 1990); Terry Hankner (President, co-owner)
- **Tech Stack:** Microsoft IIS, Facebook Pixel, Google Remarketing, LeadingRE network. **No specific CRM or transaction management platform identified** — a potential gap.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor (21 reviews): commission structure ~30% lower than industry average
  - Leadership communication described as "occasionally condescending"
  - Actively hiring: Office Administrator, Coordinator Assistant, Front Desk Receptionist
  - Moved/consolidated offices in 2025 (impacting ~40 employees) — cost management or restructuring
- **Why:** Large enough to have real operational pain, independent ownership means local decision-making, active admin hiring signals workflow gaps. The lack of identifiable modern CRM/transaction platform is a strong signal.

### RE/MAX Preferred Group (Locally Owned Franchise)
- **Website:** https://www.preferredgrouprealtors.com
- **Size:** ~150 agents, 10 offices
- **Founded:** 1998
- **Key People:** Chris Beresford (Co-Owner); Myles Beresford (Co-Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** BoldTrail (formerly kvCORE/Inside Real Estate). RE/MAX national tools, locally managed.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Agent review: **"The Bold Trail, when used properly, works"** — adoption/utilization of CRM is clearly an issue
  - 10 offices with ~15 agents each = multi-office management challenge
  - Local franchise owners make local decisions
- **Why:** Confirmed CRM adoption issues directly from an agent review. 10-office operation with multi-location complexity. Locally-owned.

### Cincy Flat Fee, LLC
- **Website:** https://cincyflatfee.com
- **Size:** ~5-10 agents
- **Key People:** Dan (Broker/Owner, UC Finance & Real Estate degree); Jen (likely co-owner); Julia Klaene (agent)
- **Tech Stack:** No CRM, transaction management, or tech tools publicly identified.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Flat-fee model ($1,500/transaction instead of 3%) = high volume essential to revenue
  - Every operational inefficiency directly impacts the bottom line
  - BBB A+ rating, 68 Birdeye reviews = active business but tiny team
  - Pricing tiers include full-service coordination (negotiations, inspections, document prep, closing) — all handled by small team
  - No visible tech stack + high-volume/low-margin model = classic recipe for manual process overload
- **Why:** Small team, high-volume model, thin margins, full-service commitment, and no visible tech. This brokerage likely has acute operational pain.

## Priority 2

### Team Herr / Private Real Estate Collection
- **Website:** https://teamherr.com
- **Size:** ~10-15 team members
- **Key People:** Heather Herr (CEO & Founder); Kelly (Ops Manager); Ann (Transaction Coordinator)
- **Tech Stack:** Claims "proprietary software platforms." No third-party CRM named.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Rapid growth: $15M to projected $100M in annual volume over four years
  - Multi-state (OH, KY, FL)
  - Invested in "robust back-office team infrastructure" in 2018 — hit a wall and had to rebuild ops
  - Dedicated ops manager and transaction coordinator = manual human roles doing heavy lifting
- **Why:** Named ops roles, multi-state complexity, tech-aware owner. "Proprietary platform" claim could be marketing language for a cobbled-together stack.

### Keynote Realtors
- **Website:** https://www.keynoterealtors.com
- **Size:** ~10-25 agents
- **Key People:** Nichell (Director of Marketing, named contact for agent recruitment)
- **Tech Stack:** **Nothing.** Only tech amenity listed: "Fast Roadrunner Internet Connections."
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Commission split starts 60/40, then 70/30 — not competitive in 2026
  - Also runs Keynote Realty Property Management (separate office, different phone number)
  - Zero observable tech stack = heavy reliance on manual processes
  - Separate property management operation = potentially fragmented ops between divisions
- **Why:** Classic small independent brokerage with minimal tech, property management side-business, and likely significant manual workflow pain.

### RE/MAX Victory + Affiliates
- **Website:** https://www.joinvictory.com
- **Size:** ~220 agents, 7 offices
- **Key People:** Tyler Morton (Broker/Owner, Ohio); Rod Fussinger, Kent Dailey, Jim Schack (Broker/Owners, Kentucky)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 2020 merger of RE/MAX Victory and RE/MAX Affiliates = tech stack integration was a recent challenge
  - Split ownership (Morton = OH, Fussinger/Dailey/Schack = KY)
  - "Fastest growing REMAX in Southern Ohio and Northern Kentucky"
  - 220 agents across 7 offices = 30+ agents per office
- **Why:** Post-merger integration, multi-state ops with split ownership, rapid growth.

## Priority 3

### Plum Tree Realty
- **Website:** https://www.plumtreerealty.com
- **Size:** ~20-40+ agents
- **Key People:** Kevin Conley (EVP Sales)
- **Tech Stack:** kvCORE CRM (free to agents), Dotloop (free to agents). 100% commission model ($275/month flat fee).
- **Why:** Known tech stack. Thin-margin model may limit budget, but efficiency gains have outsized impact. Question is whether anyone is managing/configuring tools centrally.

### TREO Realtors
- **Website:** https://www.treorealtors.com
- **Size:** ~15-20 agents
- **Key People:** Brett Keppler (Broker/Owner, also founded Nekst — a task-management SaaS for real estate agents)
- **Tech Stack:** Dotloop, DocuSign, likely Nekst internally.
- **Why:** Tech-savvy owner who built a SaaS product out of his own brokerage pain. May self-solve, but excellent conversation partner and potential referral/network partner.

### Cutler Real Estate
- **Website:** https://www.cutlerhomes.com
- **Size:** ~100+ agents, 2 Cincinnati offices
- **Key People:** Andy Camp (Owner & President since 2017)
- **Tech Stack:** Delta Media Group platform. Tech-forward culture documented.
- **Why:** Tech-forward leadership is good for conversation. Cincinnati is their expansion market, potentially with less mature local ops.

### HUFF Realty
- **Website:** https://www.huff.com
- **Size:** ~100-200+ agents
- **Key People:** Susan Huff (Owner/Broker, 40 years as REALTOR)
- **Tech Stack:** In-house marketing/social media/tech team. Proprietary HUFF App. "Online business center." Berkshire Hathaway affiliate.
- **Why:** Has more resources but also more complexity. In-house tech team signals the BH-provided tools have gaps.

### Bonus: The Chabris Group / KW Seven Hills Realty
- **Website:** https://asktcg.com
- **Size:** 500+ clients/year. Top 10 brokerage by agent count.
- **Key People:** Peter Chabris (Team Leader and Broker/Owner)
- **Pain Signals:** Actively hiring transaction coordinators — job posting specifically mentions "completing and filing appropriate paperwork," "overseeing deadlines," "nurturing clients." KW Command platform + cold calling + door knocking.
- **Why:** 500+ annual transactions with active TC hiring = operation straining at the seams.

# LAW FIRMS

- **Website:** https://www.oal-law.com/
- **Size:** ~13 attorneys, multiple offices (Downtown Cincinnati + Columbus + satellites in OH and NKY)

- **Tech Stack:** CrazyEgg (heatmaps), Optimizely (A/B testing), ApexChat (live chat), Ngage Live, AppRiver (email security), McAfee SaaS Email, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager. Sophisticated marketing tech, likely ahead of back-office.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor 2.9/5 from 25 reviews
  - Indeed reviews: **"work environment is stressful due to constant competition"**
  - **"Workload for paralegals is entirely too much"**
  - **"Very high turnover"**
  - Multiple offices = coordination challenges
  - High-volume PI = massive caseload
- **Why:** Documented paralegal burnout and turnover. Marketing tech is sophisticated but back-office likely isn't. The paralegal workload complaint is the exact pain your automation services address.

### Barron Peck Bennie & Schlemmer Co., LPA
- **Website:** https://bpbslaw.com/
- **Size:** ~10 attorneys, 35 total employees
- **Founded:** 100+ years ago

- **Pain Signals:**
  - **"Maintained its current size with the conscious goal of being able to retain a personalized approach"** — framing constraints as features
  - 12+ distinct practice areas across ~10 attorneys with 35 staff = complex, multi-workflow operations
  - Estate planning + real estate + M&A = extremely document-heavy
  - 2 offices (OH + KY)
- **Why:** 100+ year old firm. The "conscious choice to stay small" language often masks "we can't grow because our processes don't scale." Managing partner identified with 16+ years in role.

### Finney Law Firm, LLC
- **Website:** https://finneylawfirm.com/
- **Size:** 16 attorneys, 3 offices
- **Founded:** 2014
- **Key People:** Christopher P. Finney (Founder); Kevin J. Hopper (President)
- **Practice Areas:** Business Formation, Real Estate, Estate Planning, Commercial Litigation, Zoning/Land Use, 11+ other areas
- **Tech Stack:** States it "utilizes highly productive technology" but no specific platforms named.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 16 attorneys across 3 offices in 14+ practice areas = operationally complex
  - Founded 2014 = relatively young, may not have mature tech stack
  - Real estate + business formation + estate planning = document-intensive
- **Why:** Tech-aspirational language means they're receptive. Young firm still building their stack. 3 offices + 14 practice areas = real complexity.

## Priority 2

### Musillo Unkenholt Immigration Law, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.muimmigration.com/
- **Size:** 10+ attorneys, 20-44 total staff
- **Key People:** Christopher T. Musillo (Managing Partner); Cindy J. Unkenholt (Co-Founding Partner)

- **Tech Stack:** Emphasizes "flat fees for services and superior case management." Likely uses specialized platforms (INSZoom, Docketwise, LawLogix).

### Bartlett & Weigle Co., L.P.A.
- **Website:** https://bartlettlaw.com/
- **Size:** 7 attorneys, 11 support staff (~18 total)
- **Founded:** 1981
- **Key People:** Douglas S. Weigle (Co-Founder); Bill Bartlett (Co-Founder)
- **Practice Areas:** Immigration, Criminal, Family Law, Estate Planning, Business Litigation, PI
- **Why:** Immigration + family + estate = multiple document-heavy practice areas with different workflow needs. 7 attorneys across 5+ practice areas with 11 staff = heavy admin burden per person.

### Freking Myers & Reul, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.fmr.law/
- **Size:** 12-14 attorneys, 3 offices (Cincinnati, Dayton, Denver)
- **Key People:** Kelly Mulloy Myers (Managing Partner)
- **Practice Areas:** Employment Law, PI, Education Law, Whistleblower/Qui Tam
- **Why:** Multi-state, multi-office. Employment law = extensive discovery. Was hiring Admin Assistant = operational growing pains. 300+ years combined experience may mean resistance to tech change.

### Treleven & Klingensmith, LLC

- **Size:** ~6-8 attorneys, 3 locations
- **Key People:** John D. Treleven (Partner); Nicholas Klingensmith (Partner)
- **Practice Areas:** Divorce/Family Law, Estate Planning, PI, Criminal Defense, Business Consultation

  - Formed from a **2020 merger** of Treleven Law LLC and Klingensmith Law LLC — mergers create system integration challenges
  - "Best law firm in Cincinnati" by CityBeat 5 years running, 4.9 stars (53 reviews) = high client volume
  - Squarespace website, no client portal
- **Why:** Merger integration may still be ongoing. High client volume with likely manual systems.

## Priority 3

### Schimpf, Ginocchio, Kehres & Clark
- **Website:** https://www.sgkclaw.com/
- **Size:** ~5 attorneys, 20+ total employees
- **Practice Areas:** Family Law, Estate Planning, PI, Business Law, Social Security Disability, Workers' Comp

- **Size:** ~4 attorneys + support
- **Founded:** 1951
- **Key People:** Terrence M. Donnellon; Thomas E. Donnellon; R. Douglas Miller (Partners)

- **Size:** Small (2-3 attorneys)
- **Key People:** Neil Fleischer (Lead Attorney)
- **Practice Areas:** Immigration Law (exclusively since 1973)

# PROGRESSIVE NONPROFITS

## Priority 1

### Green Umbrella
- **Website:** https://greenumbrella.org
- **Size:** ~16 employees
- **Revenue:** ~$1.83M (FY 2024)
- **Key People:** Ryan Mooney-Bullock (Executive Director, $84,959 compensation)
- **Mission:** Regional sustainability alliance. Climate action, environmental justice, equitable access to green spaces.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Grew from 4 to 16 staff in a few years
  - Revenue from $720K to $2M
  - Operating at a deficit ($2.07M expenses vs $1.83M revenue)
  - Nearly half of expenses are salaries
  - 73.7% grant-dependent
  - Previously posted a Director of Finance role — professionalizing back-office
- **Why:** Squarely in the sweet spot. Rapid scaling (4x staff growth) almost certainly means they've outgrown their original donor management and volunteer tracking systems.

### Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME)
- **Website:** https://www.homecincy.org
- **Size:** 35 employees
- **Revenue:** ~$1.4M (FY 2024)
- **Key People:** Elisabeth Risch (ED); LaTonya Springs (Asst. Director); **Denese Benn (Director of Finance and Operations)**; Janet Brown (Director of Tenant Advocacy); Rebecca Griffin (Director of Education)
- **Mission:** Eliminating unlawful housing discrimination. Fair housing enforcement, Section 8 mobility, eviction prevention, mediation, education.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 97% of revenue is grants — heavy grant management burden
  - 71% of expenses are salaries = very people-heavy operation
  - Spanish-language specialist + Testing and Investigations Coordinator = complex case management needs
  - Policy and Research Coordinator = data-intensive work
- **Why:** Right in the sweet spot. **Denese Benn (Director of Finance & Operations) is the perfect buyer.** She's the "Backbone" persona from your voice doc.

### Groundwork Ohio River Valley

  - Distributes grants to partner organizations ($279K in 2024) — grants on both receiving and giving side
  - EPA-funded programs require rigorous reporting
  - Founded only in 2019 — systems still being built
- **Why:** Explosive growth, complex workforce management, young organization with likely immature tech stack. The seasonal workforce management alone is a massive operational challenge.

### Ohio Justice & Policy Center (OJPC)
- **Website:** https://ohiojpc.org
- **Size:** ~25 employees, 2 offices (Cincinnati + Columbus)
- **Revenue:** ~$2M-$6M (growth trajectory)
- **Key People:** David Singleton (ED/President & CEO, but currently seeking replacement — leadership transition)
- **Mission:** Nonprofit law firm creating fair criminal justice systems through client-centered advocacy, policy reform, community education.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Rapid revenue growth ($2M to $6M)
  - Legal case management + policy advocacy + community education = multiple workstreams likely using different tools
  - Two offices require shared systems
  - **Currently seeking new President & CEO — leadership transition is when organizations re-evaluate infrastructure**
- **Why:** Growing fast, complex operations, leadership transition creates an opening for infrastructure conversations.

## Priority 2 (Strategic)

### Community Shares of Greater Cincinnati
- **Website:** https://cintishares.org
- **Size:** 4 employees
- **Revenue:** ~$299K (FY 2024)
- **Key People:** T. Duane Gordon (CEO)
- **Mission:** Federation of 31 progressive nonprofits + 14 Social Justice Incubator organizations. Federated fundraising. Fiscal sponsorship. Professional training.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 4 people managing operations for a 45-org federation
  - Revenue declining (-4.1% YoY), expenses rising (+3.6%), assets dropping (-32.3%)
  - Fiscal sponsorship requires robust accounting and reporting
  - Federated fundraising means managing workplace giving campaigns across employers
- **Why:** Small as a direct client, but **STRATEGIC as a gateway to 45 progressive nonprofits in their network.** Solving their problems could create a pipeline to the entire Cincinnati progressive ecosystem.

### Women Helping Women
- **Website:** https://womenhelpingwomen.org
- **Size:** ~85 employees
- **Revenue:** ~$5.5M annual budget
- **Key People:** Kristin Shrimplin
- **Mission:** Preventing gender-based violence and empowering survivors. 24/7 hotline, hospital response across 25 hospitals, on-scene domestic violence response (DVERT), four counties.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Grew from 17 to 85 employees and $975K to $5.5M budget
  - 24/7 hotline + multi-county + 25 hospital partnerships = scheduling, case management, and donor system complexity
  - Organizations that grow this fast often carry legacy systems from their smaller days
- **Why:** Slightly above the sweet spot but the complexity and growth trajectory are compelling. Massive scaling likely means legacy systems.

### Over-the-Rhine Community Housing (OTRCH)
- **Website:** https://otrch.org
- **Size:** 56 employees
- **Revenue:** ~$13.8M (FY 2024, up 77% YoY)

- **Mission:** Developing and managing 538 affordable housing units serving 980 residents.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 77% revenue growth in one year
  - Property management + resident services + development pipeline = disconnected systems

## Priority 3

### Immigrant & Refugee Law Center (IRLC)
- **Website:** https://www.irlawcenter.org
- **Size:** 5 employees + 30 volunteers
- **Revenue:** ~$439K (FY 2022, likely growing)
- **Key People:** Mayra Casas Jackson (ED, took over from founder Julie Leftwich in 2024)
- **Mission:** Pro bono legal services for low-income immigrant and refugee families.
- **Why:** Recent leadership transition. Immigration law = meticulous case tracking. 30 volunteers need coordination. Slightly below revenue floor but growing.

### Ohio Organizing Collaborative (OOC)

- **Size:** ~25 employees across Ohio
- **Key People:** Molly Shack (Executive Director)

### Equality Ohio (Cincinnati hub)
- **Website:** https://www.equalityohio.org
- **Mission:** Statewide LGBTQ+ advocacy and legal aid.
- **Why:** Multi-city operations with Cincinnati presence. Legal clinics require case management. Worth investigating further.

- **Website:** https://cincyvotes.org
- **Size:** Primarily volunteer-led, transitioning to paid staff
- **Mission:** Non-partisan civic engagement. Coalition of 54 organizations.
- **Why:** Low revenue prospect currently but **connector to 54 civic organizations.** Strategic value similar to Community Shares.

# MEDICAL / DENTAL PRACTICES

## Priority 1 (Strongest Pain Signals)

### Cincinnati Dental Services (CDS)
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatidentalservices.com/
- **Size:** ~51-200 employees, 9 locations across SW Ohio and NKY
- **Founded:** ~1970s (50+ years)
- **Key People:** Kevin M. Lee, DDS (Ferguson/Eastgate); individual location teams with office-level managers (not publicly named)
- **Tech Stack:** Employee reviews note "the computer system is hard to learn." 9 separate office websites suggest fragmented digital presence.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: Patient **"charged $2,319 upfront for dentures"** and **"overcharged by $1,167"**
  - BBB: **"Calling the office numerous times to request explanations of charges with no one answering the phone or returning calls"**
  - BBB: Billing department **"changed their insurance coverage from one plan to another without notifying the customer"**
  - BBB: Patient **"called the billing office in December 2023, January 2024, and again in February 2024 regarding an overpayment but had not been refunded"**
  - BBB: **"The billing manager was not in (vacation, family emergency, etc.) and were promised callbacks that never came"**
  - Indeed: **"The computer system is hard to learn"**
- **Why:** 9 locations with fragmented billing systems, insurance coding errors, and chronic communication breakdowns. Patients calling 3+ months for refunds hitting voicemail. No centralized system connecting scheduling, billing, and patient communication.

### Kings Dental
- **Website:** https://www.kings.dental/
- **Size:** 19-27 employees, 2 locations, 4 doctors
- **Founded:** ~2021-2022 (3 years old, 11,000+ patients)
- **Key People:** Dr. Guy Gunacar (CEO/Owner); Mr. Ismail Gunacar (Co-Owner); Dr. Baljinder Singh; Dr. Sasha Hayes
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor: **"Management is terrible, major drama, no organization, no training, and unprofessional environment"**
  - Glassdoor: **"Scheduling Coordinators have responsibilities that should be divided into four different positions"**
  - Glassdoor: **"They fire people and go through employees like water"**
  - Glassdoor: **"When employees think they're understanding the job, more work is added to their load"**
- **Why:** Fast-growing 3-year-old practice that has outgrown its operational foundation. Scheduling Coordinators doing the work of four people screams for workflow automation. Dr. Gunacar is the quintessential "Reluctant Operator" -- a dentist-turned-CEO scaling without infrastructure.

### The Urology Group
- **Website:** https://www.urologygroup.com/
- **Size:** 45+ physicians, 5+ locations
- **Key People:** Michael Galvin (CEO, new as of late 2025); Stephen Kappa, MD, MBA (President); Brooke Edwards, MD (CMO); Tami (Office Manager named in complaints); Earl Walz (CEO Emeritus)
- **Tech Stack:** Sharecare for records. IPC network member. BBB patient: **"abundant need to update and upgrade their medical records system -- clunky and unreliable"**
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: **"Abundant need to update and upgrade their medical records system -- clunky and unreliable"**
  - BBB: Patient **"billed multiple times for things they had already paid"**
  - BBB: Patient with prostate cancer diagnosis reported **"difficulty scheduling surgery"** -- 2-3 week pre-authorization delays
  - BBB: **"Communication with offices is poor, with difficulty getting call backs from doctors"**
  - Glassdoor: 3.1/5 overall; 2.4/5 compensation
  - Indeed: Patient Care Coordinator -- **"workload was always overwhelming"**
- **Why:** New CEO (late 2025) = change mandate. Patient reviews explicitly call out "clunky and unreliable" medical records. Duplicate billing, collections sent without original bills. Disconnected systems between scheduling, billing, insurance verification, and records.

### Mindfully Behavioral Health
- **Website:** https://mindfully.com/
- **Size:** 201-500 employees, 7-14 offices (originally Compass Point Counseling, founded 2006)
- **Key People:** Leadership not publicly named. 31 open positions. 95,000+ sessions/year.
- **Tech Stack:** Uses **PRN** for clinical documentation -- employees describe it as **"absolute garbage"**
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor: **"Management was described as 'a hot mess'"**
  - Glassdoor: **"Employees constantly referred from one individual to another to get questions answered"**
  - Glassdoor: **"Communication is minimal and typically last minute"**
  - Glassdoor: **"Training is hit or miss depending on who runs it"**
  - Glassdoor: 3.1/5 overall; 41% would recommend
- **Why:** Documentation software employees openly despise. Management communication breakdown across 7-14 locations. 31 open positions. No standardized operational playbook. May exceed target size but massive ops pain.

### Dermatology & Advanced Skin Care
- **Website:** Not publicly identified (Glassdoor/Indeed reviews only)
- **Size:** Multi-location, husband-and-wife owned
- **Key People:** Husband-and-wife owner team (names not specified)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor: **"Management was poor, certain people did A LOT more work than others"**
  - Glassdoor: **"Corporate company is clueless about clinic needs"**
  - Glassdoor: **"They can never hold a manager for a long period of time"**
  - Glassdoor: **"High turnover rate due to bad management"**
  - Indeed: **"Run by husband and wife who did not care much about employees"**
- **Why:** The inability to retain an office manager is perhaps the strongest pain signal possible. When "they can never hold a manager for a long period of time," the role is impossible because the systems are broken -- the person IS expected to be the system.

## Priority 2

### Emergency Dental of America (Cincinnati)
- **Website:** https://www.emergencydentalofamerica.com/
- **Size:** 24 offices nationwide; Cincinnati expanding to 2nd office
- **Key People:** Jared Derr (Founder, former Dentrix consultant 1999-2002); Dr. Roberto Monteagudo (Co-Founder)
- **Tech Stack:** Dentrix likely. Hiring Practice Manager ($72-80K) for 2nd Cincinnati location.
- **Pain Signals:** Indeed: **"The manager is extremely disorganized"**; weekend-mandatory scheduling; benefit coverage misrepresentation allegations.
- **Why:** Expanding to 2nd Cincinnati location = duplication moment. Founder's Dentrix expertise may mean they've hit its limitations at scale.

### Dermatology Specialists of Greater Cincinnati
- **Website:** https://derm-specialists.net/
- **Size:** ~10-20 employees, 1 location
- **Key People:** Tiffany Pickup, MD (lead); Amanda Crone, MD; **Jessica Gross (Practice Manager, 15+ years medical leadership, since 2016)**; Meghan Jez, PA-C (since 2013)
- **Pain Signals:** Indeed: **"Very busy at times"** with manual check-in process. **"Management doesn't communicate about areas for improvement until evaluations."** Practice administrator **"seemed intrusive"** = micromanagement from lack of system visibility.
- **Why:** Jessica Gross is the textbook "Backbone" persona. High patient volume, fast pace, communication gaps.

### Concierge Medicine of Cincinnati / Ms.Medicine
- **Website:** https://conciergemedicineofcincinnati.com/
- **Size:** 11 physicians/clinicians, 3 locations (Mariemont, Mason, Kenwood) + national Ms.Medicine network (17 providers, 11 locations, 8 states)
- **Key People:** Dr. Lisa Larkin (Founder/President/Owner); plus 10 named providers
- **Why:** Physician-entrepreneur scaling two businesses simultaneously. Dual revenue model (concierge fees + DPC subscriptions) creates data/billing complexity. No visible COO.

### Cincinnati Allergy & Asthma Center
- **Website:** https://caac-inc.com/
- **Size:** 3 locations (Hyde Park, Anderson, Mason); 4+ physicians
- **Founded:** 1960
- **Key People:** Dr. Ann C. Ghory; Dr. Patricia K. Ghory (daughters of founder)
- **Pain Signals:** Indeed: **"Work culture is very negative and employees all seem very unhappy"** (2.0/5 management). **"Very high turnover rate."** New Anderson location opening July 2025.
- **Why:** 65-year-old 2nd-gen family practice expanding to 3rd location. Multi-generational practices accumulate "the way we've always done it" processes.

### Baker Chiropractic and Wellness
- **Website:** https://bakerchiropractic.org/
- **Size:** 18 employees, 3 locations (Madisonville, Fairfield, West Chester)
- **Founded:** 1994
- **Key People:** Dr. Paul Baker (Co-Owner, twin); Dr. Patrick Baker (Co-Owner, twin); Dr. Clay Baker
- **Pain Signals:** Indeed: Office Manager **"sending out easily 50+ emails a day starting at like 4:30 in the am"**. Multi-disciplinary (chiro + PT + massage + dry needling + corporate wellness).
- **Why:** Office manager sending 50+ emails/day at 4:30 AM = manual communication substituting for automated workflows. 18 staff across 3 locations with 5+ service types.

### The Cole Center for Healing
- **Website:** https://www.colecenter.com/
- **Size:** Small team, 1 location (West Chester, OH)
- **Key People:** Dr. Theodore J. Cole (President/Founder, 30+ years)
- **Pain Signals:** Indeed: **"All that is valued by owners is the money"**; **"Constantly told how expendable you are."** Associated Cincinnati Hyperbarics entity = separate billing/scheduling.
- **Why:** Integrative medicine = dual billing complexity (insurance + cash-pay). 30+ years of accumulated non-standard workflows.

### Pain Specialists of Cincinnati / RegenLife Centers
- **Website:** https://www.paincincinnati.com/ / https://www.regenlifecenters.com/
- **Size:** ~10 employees, 2 locations (Cincinnati OH + Edgewood KY)
- **Founded:** 2015
- **Key People:** Dr. Zeeshan Tayeb (Lead physician); Heather Rapp (Front Desk); Kim Shields (Precertifications Rep)
- **Why:** 6 distinct service lines across 2 states with 10 employees. Pain management is one of the most prior-authorization-heavy specialties. Single person (Kim Shields) handling precertifications is a bottleneck.

## Priority 3

### Eastgate Dental Excellence
- **Website:** https://eastgatedentalexcellence.com/
- **Size:** ~14 employees, 1 location
- **Founded:** 1982
- **Key People:** Dr. Daniel Kelley (Co-Owner); Dr. Jodie Yildirim (Co-Owner); **Michelle (Office Manager, hygienist since 2006, transitioned to office manager 2014)**
- **Why:** Michelle is a clinician-turned-administrator managing for 10+ years. Successful but at capacity (618+ reviews). "Good practice that could be great with better systems."

### Meier, Layer and Yu
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatidentists.com/
- **Size:** 3 dentists, 1 location
- **Key People:** Dr. Melissa Meier; Dr. Cameron Layer; Dr. Jennifer Yu
- **Why:** 20+ year partnership. No visible operations role = one of the dentists handling ops. Digital X-rays and Invisalign suggest clinical tech investment that hasn't reached operations.

---

# PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

## Priority 1

### Gaslight Property LLC
- **Website:** https://www.gaslightproperty.com/
- **Size:** ~50+ employees, 1,800+ units (primarily Clifton, near UC and hospitals)
- **Founded:** 1992
- **Key People:** Dave Taylor (CEO/Founder); **Rob Taylor (COO, from 29 years restaurant management)**; Rick Taylor (Maintenance Supervisor); **Gidget McMeekin (VP of Property Management, 20+ years, since 2017)**
- **Tech Stack:** **AppFolio** confirmed (tenant portal: gaslightproperty.appfolio.com/connect)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Very disorganized management"**
  - Indeed: **"So disorganized that they frequently lose tenant payments, keys, and other items"**
  - Indeed: **"Such a large turnover that it's hard to keep up with who is supposed to do what"**
  - BBB: **"I made over 50 calls to the leasing office over the course of a week, yet received no answers or callbacks"**
  - Glassdoor: Compensation rated 1.5/5
- **Why:** Strongest property management prospect. Family-run managing 1,800+ units with documented dysfunction. Literally losing tenant payments. COO from restaurant management (not PM or tech). AppFolio likely massively underutilized. High turnover = constant retraining and lost institutional knowledge.

### RPM Midwest (Real Property Management)
- **Website:** https://rpmmidwest.com/
- **Size:** ~18 employees, 1,000+ properties across OH and KY
- **Founded:** 25+ years; franchise independently operated
- **Key People:** Sam Thompson (Owner); **Heather Monson (Office Manager)**
- **Tech Stack:** **Propertyware** confirmed (tenant portal: rpmmidwestnew.propertyware.com)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - PissedConsumer: **"It is virtually impossible to get a hold of anyone at the company, with phones ringing for literally days"**
  - BBB: Took **"almost 2 weeks"** to get answers about a refund
  - Glassdoor: **"Upper management is horrible, no benefits"**
  - Suspicious related repair company (Blue Bear Repair) owned by same person
- **Why:** 1,000+ properties managed by 18 people. Phone literally "rings for days." Propertyware is capable but clearly not being used to automate communication. Heather Monson (Office Manager) = Backbone holding it together.

### True Home Ohio Property Management
- **Website:** https://www.truehomeohio.com/
- **Size:** ~5-15 employees, 100+ units
- **Founded:** ~2018-2019
- **Key People:** Owner not publicly identified
- **Tech Stack:** **Buildium** (tenant portal: thopropertymanagement.managebuilding.com) AND **Property Meld** for maintenance -- two disconnected systems
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **BBB F rating**. Failed to respond to 3 of 4 complaints.
  - Tenant without heat for 7 days in February
- **Why:** Textbook Ops for Shops case. Running Buildium for financial management AND Property Meld for maintenance in parallel. Data lives in two places, nothing syncs. BBB F rating from failure to respond = overwhelmed operations.

### Realiant Property Management
- **Website:** https://www.realiantpm.com/
- **Size:** ~19 employees, 168+ units, 3 cities (Cincinnati, Covington KY, Lexington KY)
- **Founded:** 2010
- **Key People:** Josh House (Owner); David Tyler Oatts (President)
- **Tech Stack:** Wix website (low-tech indicator). No visible PMS portal.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: Collapsed ceiling not addressed until tenant vacated; mice and rats for two years
  - BBB: **"Put in 3 additional maintenance orders to get the window fixed and it is not fixed"** -- after 2 months
  - BBB: Landlord eventually **"blocking the tenant's number"**
- **Why:** Multi-location coordination breaking down. Maintenance orders unresolved for months. Business "fails to respond" to BBB disputes.

## Priority 2

### Uptown Rental Properties
- **Website:** https://uptownrents.com/
- **Size:** 132 employees, 4,000+ units, 160 properties, 3 states, 17 neighborhoods
- **Founded:** ~1987
- **Key People:** Dan Schimberg (Founder/President); Craig Coffman (CFO); **Johnna Mullikin (VP of Property Management)**
- **Tech Stack:** **Rent Manager** (confirmed, attended RMUC23)
- **Pain Signals:** Glassdoor: **"A lot of good workers have left"**; **"Upper management micromanaging"**; 86 student properties = massive annual turnover cycles.
- **Why:** Larger end of target but independently owned. 4,000+ units, 86 student properties (annual turnover chaos). Micromanaging signal = leadership doesn't trust systems.

### Zinger Property Group
- **Website:** https://zingerpropertygroup.com/
- **Size:** ~16 employees, multi-state (Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Columbus), $18M revenue
- **Key People:** Carl Schirtzinger (Owner/President); **Laurie Carmona (Dir of Accounting & Personnel)**; **Gretchen Jones (Asst. Dir of Operations)**; **Janine Friedel (System Analyst)**
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Employed by terror, overworked hours, and backwards tomfoolery"**
  - Indeed: **"Lack of structure in accounting team"** / **"no structure"** / **"no support"**
  - Cincinnati 4.5 stars vs Indianapolis 1.6 and Columbus 1.5 = ops deteriorate remotely
- **Why:** Dedicated System Analyst on staff = technology is already a recognized pain. Operations work when owner is physically present but fall apart remotely = tribal knowledge, not systems.

### EquityTeam
- **Website:** https://equityteam.com/
- **Size:** ~9 employees, $100M+ in assets, 3,000+ transactions since founding
- **Founded:** 2005
- **Key People:** Mark Thompson (Founder/CEO)
- **Pain Signals:** Yelp: **"No one ever answers the phone"**; **"ignored 14 phone calls during business hours"**
- **Why:** 9 employees managing $100M+ assets. Basic communication workflows not automated. Investor-turned-PM = Reluctant Operator.

### Cincy Rents
- **Website:** https://www.cincyrents.com/
- **Size:** ~9 employees, large portfolio
- **Key People:** **Lora Miller (Operations Manager / Controller / Business Manager)**
- **Tech Stack:** PHP 5.6 website (end of life since 2018). Departmentalized (Leasing, Maintenance, Accounting).
- **Why:** Lora Miller is both Controller AND Ops Manager -- single-handedly bridging accounting, operations, and leasing. PHP 5.6 website = behind on tech. Information silos despite small team.

### PMI Gatekeeper Realty
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatipropertymanagementinc.com/
- **Size:** 11-50 employees
- **Key People:** **Jeff Post (Owner/Broker, former Process Engineer with manufacturing/Industrial Engineering background from UC)**
- **Pain Signals:** Reportedly hung up on a prospective client mid-call = stretched thin.
- **Why:** Jeff Post is a former Process Engineer -- he inherently understands operations and would be receptive to ops optimization conversations. Running franchise tech stack but likely layering spreadsheets on top.

### All County NEO Queen City
- **Website:** https://www.allcountyprop.com/locations/ohio/cincinnati/
- **Size:** ~16+ employees (including offshore)
- **Key People:** Roy Guy (Owner); Rob Grahovac (Owner); **Ellen Downie, Shannon Keeling, Tabatha Keller, Jonnel Bansil (all Operations Managers)**
- **Why:** FOUR Operations Managers in a 16-person company = operations is the core pain. Onshore + offshore staff adds coordination complexity. Franchise compliance adds overhead.

## Priority 3

### Kleemax Properties
- **Website:** https://www.kleemax.com/
- **Size:** ~5-10 employees, upscale apartments (Hyde Park, Mt. Lookout, Oakley)
- **Key People:** Bill Klee (Owner)
- **Pain Signals:** 1.3-star Birdeye rating. **"Email-only communication"** -- can't reach emergency support by phone.
- **Why:** Email-only policy = survival mechanism from someone who can't handle phone volume. 1.3 stars for upscale apartments = operational breakdown.

### TLP Property Management
- **Website:** https://www.tlp-management.com/
- **Size:** ~5-10 employees, 100+ units
- **Key People:** Slocomb Reed (Owner)
- **Why:** Founded 2020, scaling past 100 units. Growth-stage friction visible in "needing more information" for applications.

### Neyer Management
- **Website:** https://neyermanagement.com/
- **Size:** ~54 employees, 275+ properties, 30M+ sq ft (primarily commercial)
- **Pain Signals:** Indeed: **"Sets you up for failure."** 600%+ growth. Hiring Senior PM.
- **Why:** Larger and commercial-focused. 600% growth means rapid scaling.

### 3CRE Real Estate Advisors
- **Website:** https://3cre.com/
- **Size:** ~10-20 employees, expanding to Columbus and Nashville
- **Key People:** Mike Costantini and Tryfon Christoforou (Co-Founders)
- **Why:** Dual brokerage + PM business. Co-founders are brokers by trade, not operations people. Multi-city expansion will stress-test ad-hoc processes.

---

# CONSTRUCTION / TRADES

## Priority 1

### Justin Doyle Homes
- **Website:** https://justindoylehomes.com/
- **Size:** ~27 employees, custom luxury homes
- **Founded:** 1976 (50 years, Doyle family)
- **Key People:** Ryan Kuenkel (President); **Joshua Agricola (COO)**; Ty Barth (VP Production); Matt Terrell (VP Sales/Marketing); Ray Noel (PM/Controller); Kathie Sheldon (Purchasing); Bailey Whisman (Selections)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: **"Because of the high turnover and very poor communication, many mistakes have been made resulting in their roof being reframed twice, their cabinets being reinstalled 3 times"**
  - BBB: **"There is a lack of communication and accountability for missed deadlines"**
  - BBB: Repairs identified Dec 2022, agreed Dec 2023, **"all repair activities ceased in May 2024"** with **"no further communication"**
  - Company admitted **"one of their email responses was returned undelivered"** -- fragile communication systems
- **Why:** Roof reframed twice, cabinets reinstalled 3 times = not quality issues but PROJECT MANAGEMENT failures. COO already in place = aware of the problem. 50-year family business outgrowing its systems.

### Legacy Builders Group
- **Website:** https://www.designbuildremodel.com/
- **Size:** ~22 employees
- **Founded:** 1991 (Otte + Haussler merged 2005)
- **Key People:** Chris Otte (Co-Owner/Lead Designer); Bill Haussler (Co-Owner/Lead Designer); **Grace Haussler (Office Manager)**; Kevin Haussler (Production Mgr); **Lindsey Schneeberg (Process Engineer)**; Laura Pott (Accounting); Joe Rott (Estimator)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor: **"Senior management completely detached from employees, zero work life balance, extremely long hours, total lack of communication"**
  - Glassdoor: **"CEO left his two unexperienced nephews in charge who are basically running this company to the ground"**
  - Glassdoor: **"Roles in the company would change constantly"** -- **"revolving door"**
- **Why:** Family business with Process Engineer on staff = they KNOW they have process problems. Owners are designers who want to be designing, not managing ops. Grace Haussler (Office Manager) is the Backbone.

### Herrmann Services
- **Website:** https://www.herrmannservices.com/
- **Size:** ~16-24 employees (plumbing, electrical, HVAC, drain cleaning)
- **Founded:** 1968 (58 years, 3rd generation)
- **Key People:** Kim Herrmann (President); Jason Herrmann (Service Manager)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor (44% would recommend): **"Communication from leadership can be unclear or delayed, making routine tasks more challenging than necessary"**
  - Glassdoor: **"Processes and expectations shift often without enough explanation or notice"**
  - Management rated 2.3/5 on Indeed
- **Why:** 58-year-old 3rd-gen family business. "Communication unclear or delayed making routine tasks harder" = no centralized system. Ad hoc operational management rather than documented workflows.

### Remark Construction
- **Website:** https://www.remarkbuilders.com/
- **Size:** ~15-20 employees (3 crews + office), residential construction
- **Key People:** Chris Kramer (President, still meets customers and does estimates); Jim Mitchell (VP, 38 years experience); **Miles Koutny (Operations Manager)**; Lisa Amspaugh (Dir Sales/Marketing); **Jake Jacobs (CFO)**; Jesse Bishop (Senior Estimator)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Angi review: Project **"told would take 4 weeks... ended up taking double that"**
  - Company publicly admitted: **"Due to intentional lack of communication and a newer Project Manager on the job, legitimate things fell through the cracks"**
  - Chris Kramer still personally meets customers and does estimates = bottleneck
- **Why:** Company publicly admitted "things fell through the cracks." President is still the estimator -- can't scale. Miles Koutny (Ops Manager) is the direct buyer.

## Priority 2

### Arlinghaus Plumbing, Heating & Air
- **Website:** https://www.arlinghausair.com/
- **Size:** 74-125 employees, $13.9M revenue
- **Key People:** Brian Arlinghaus (Owner/Co-Founder); **Heather Arlinghaus (Office Manager/Co-Founder)**; Dan Shields (Ops Manager); Ryan Houlehan (GM)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"They will send technicians to two full changeouts a day and send them with the wrong equipment and blame them for it"**
  - Indeed: **"On-call work is beyond stressful with regular days being at least 10 to 12 hours"**
  - Redwood PE investment = growth pressure
- **Why:** Sending techs with wrong equipment = dispatching and inventory failure. Heather Arlinghaus (Office Manager/Co-Founder) = perfect Backbone. Larger than target but strong signals.

### Biehl Brothers Contracting
- **Website:** https://gobiehlbrothers.com/
- **Size:** ~21 employees, $7.2M revenue, all W-2 (no subs)
- **Key People:** **Chase Biehl (President, does finance + HR + facilities)**; Ryan Biehl (VP, sales + marketing + design)
- **Why:** No visible admin staff. Chase does finance, HR, AND facilities. $7.2M revenue with zero admin support. All W-2 employees = complex payroll. Chase is simultaneously the Backbone AND the Reluctant Operator.

### Apollo Home
- **Website:** https://apollohome.com/
- **Size:** 75+ employees, $11.7M revenue (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, handyman)
- **Founded:** 1910 (acquired and rolled up by Jamie Gerdsen)
- **Key People:** Jamie Gerdsen (Sole Owner, acquired 10+ companies); Chad Lyons (President)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"The bosses have no real trade experience. They try to get you ready 40 hours a week. You wait for your call and not get paid."**
  - Indeed: **"They put people in trucks and send them to work on peoples homes with zero experience"**
  - Indeed: **"Revolving door"**
- **Why:** Built by acquisition = Frankenstein of disconnected systems. Dispatching failures (waiting, wrong assignments). Larger than target but massive ops chaos.

### HELP Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electric
- **Website:** https://333help.com/
- **Size:** ~20 employees
- **Founded:** 1932 (as Thompson Plumbing; 94 years)
- **Ownership:** Service Champions (Brea, CA) -- absentee ownership
- **Why:** 94-year-old company with bolted-on service lines over time. Now owned from California = need tight local operational systems. Management is top con on Glassdoor.

### Avsten Construction
- **Website:** https://avstenconstruction.com/
- **Size:** ~4 core employees, $7M revenue (roofing, remodeling, storm damage)
- **Key People:** Donovan McQueen (Owner); **Erin Wood (Office Manager)**
- **Why:** $7M revenue from 4 core staff = Erin Wood handles everything. Storm damage = unpredictable volume surges. Classic "Backbone is the entire back office" scenario.

### Woeste Remodeling
- **Website:** https://woesteremodeling.com/
- **Size:** ~5-12 employees
- **Founded:** 2003
- **Key People:** Tom Woeste (Principal); **Linda Woeste (President)**
- **Why:** Classic husband-wife team. Tom builds, Linda runs the business. 23 years of deeply ingrained manual processes. Not BBB accredited despite 23 years.

### Construction Solutions, Inc.
- **Website:** https://cshicincy.com/
- **Size:** ~5-15 employees (exterior remodeling)
- **Key People:** Tom Bolt (Owner, 35+ years including manufacturing/distribution)
- **Why:** "Direct access to the owner" is the selling point today but becomes bottleneck at scale. Manufacturing background may make him receptive to process solutions.

### Improveit! Home Remodeling (Cincinnati)
- **Website:** https://www.improveitusa.com/
- **Size:** 124-150+ employees, $30.6M (HQ Columbus; Cincinnati branch)
- **Key People:** Traci Snyder (VP of Marketing, People & Technology)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Cincinnati Indeed: **1.3/5 stars**
  - Glassdoor: **"80% of recently hired sales reps last less than 3 months"**
  - Customer: **"Waiting almost 3 months without having remaining work scheduled"**
- **Why:** Cincinnati branch specifically struggling (1.3/5 vs higher elsewhere). Centralized tech decisions but local execution failing.

## Priority 3

### SWORD Roofing
- **Website:** https://swordroof.com/
- **Size:** ~10-20 employees
- **Founded:** ~2017
- **Key People:** Joe Bryant, Justin Huber, Cory Bryant (Co-Owners)
- **Why:** 3 co-owners still providing on-site oversight = unsustainable at scale. "Emerging Business of Year" 2021. Sam's Club preferred installer = volume.

### DeVol Design Build Remodel
- **Website:** https://devoldbr.com/
- **Size:** ~2-5 core employees, $19M revenue
- **Key People:** Jeff DeVol (President, CAPS certified)
- **Why:** $19M on a tiny core team = extraordinary subcontractor coordination. Aging-in-place niche adds ADA compliance complexity.

### Ecosystem Note: Industry Context
Cincinnati metro added **5,800 construction jobs** between June 2024-2025 (11% increase). **78% of firms** report difficulty filling hourly craft positions. **84% of remodelers** report subcontractor shortages. Every company on this list is under pressure to do more with less.

# SUPPLIERS / DISTRIBUTORS

## Priority 1

### Keidel Supply Co.
- **Website:** https://keidel.com/
- **Size:** ~48 employees, $22.9M revenue (plumbing fixtures, cabinetry, lighting, appliances)
- **Founded:** 1911 (113 years; acquired by Winsupply Oct 2023)
- **Key People:** Mike Barton (President/CEO); John Robinson (EVP)
- **Tech Stack:** Mid-acquisition integration with Winsupply. Multiple warehouse locations + showrooms.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Products are getting lost by warehouse. Deliveries are constantly wrong."**
  - Indeed: **"Very high turnover rate"** / **"management is a nightmare"** / **"horrible communication"**
  - Indeed Cincinnati: **2.5/5 stars**
- **Why:** 113-year-old company mid-acquisition integration. Products lost, deliveries wrong = textbook inventory management breakdown. High turnover compounds the problem. Post-acquisition is prime window for ops consulting.

### Phillips Supply Company
- **Website:** https://phillipssupply.com/
- **Size:** ~55-75 employees, $20.4M revenue (janitorial/sanitary distribution)
- **Founded:** 1947 (79 years, 3rd-generation family/woman-owned)
- **Key People:** **Pamela Phillips Rossmann (President/Owner, 50+ years in business)**; Thomas Margraf (GM)
- **Tech Stack:** Government vendor (SAM.gov). FMCSA registered. No modern ERP visible.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Warehouse is small and cramped, an accident waiting to happen"**
  - Indeed: **"Expectations are high"** but **"higher ups do not lead by example"**
  - Also positive: Owners are **"absolutely amazing people"**
- **Why:** Pamela Rossmann cares deeply but systems aren't keeping up. $20M+ across healthcare, government, education customers with government compliance requirements that strain manual systems.

### Blue Ash Industrial Supply
- **Website:** https://blueashsupply.com/
- **Size:** ~81 employees, $14.2M revenue (industrial distribution, 10,000+ SKUs)
- **Founded:** 1984
- **Key People:** **Bob Ochs (CEO/President, bob@blueashsupply.com)**
- **Tech Stack:** PHP/Angular website. 12,000 sq ft warehouse. Manual picking.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"The owner walked the floor making sure everyone was in their place and not talking to each other"**
  - Customer: **"Staff was disinterested in smaller customers and nobody asked to help them"**
  - Job postings describe manual picking/inventory processes
- **Why:** Bob Ochs walking the floor to ensure people are in place = owner who doesn't trust systems. 10,000+ SKUs with manual processes. Owner IS the system -- can't scale.

### Worly Plumbing Supply
- **Website:** https://thinkworly.com/
- **Size:** ~70 employees, $24-50M revenue (plumbing, HVAC, industrial)
- **Founded:** 1952 (74 years)
- **Key People:** Jay Worly (President)
- **4 locations** (Columbus HQ, Cincinnati, Chillicothe, Delaware) juggling luxury showroom + industrial wholesale
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"The turnover rate is terrible"**
  - Warehouse work described as **"easy money"** = repetitive manual tasks
- **Why:** Luxury showroom + industrial wholesale = two fundamentally different business models sharing back-office. "Terrible turnover" in a family business. 4 locations without modern inventory sync.

### JB Doppes Sons Lumber Co.
- **Website:** https://www.doppeslumber.com/
- **Size:** ~16 employees, $2.4-3.9M revenue
- **Founded:** 1869 (157 years!)
- **Key People:** Edward Ruprecht (President, 4th generation)
- **Tech Stack:** No e-commerce. Two separate disconnected websites (doppeslumber.com and doppeslumber.net).
- **Pain Signals:** No BBB despite 157 years. Massive product catalog (lumber, plumbing, HVAC, hardware, paint, pest control, cleaning) managed by 16 people.
- **Why:** 157 years old. 16 people managing impossibly broad product catalog. Two separate websites = piecemeal tech. Ed Ruprecht running a 19th-century business that needs 21st-century operations.

## Priority 2

### Allied Supply Company
- **Website:** https://alliedsupply.com/
- **Size:** 51-200 employees, 6 Ohio locations (Dayton HQ, Cincinnati branch)
- **Founded:** 1935 (91 years, 3rd-gen Homan family)
- **Key People:** Tom Homan (President); Scott Gibbons (CFO)
- **Why:** $3M+ inventory at single branch. B2B-only = complex pricing tiers, contractor accounts, credit terms.

### Johnson Electric Supply
- **Website:** https://www.johnson-electric.com/
- **Size:** ~20-40 employees, 2 locations (119 years, 3rd/4th generation)
- **Tech Stack:** **Epicor Eclipse ERP** confirmed. $2M+ inventory.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"The product line has voids and parts inventory issues"** -- even WITH Eclipse
  - Glassdoor: **"The organization is very siloed, with each department only caring about their own KPIs"**
- **Why:** They HAVE an ERP but it's not working. Classic "we have the technology but nobody talks to each other through it." Perfect engagement: not "buy new tools" but "make your expensive tools actually work."

### Cincinnati Fastener & Industrial Supply
- **Website:** https://cincinnatifastener.com/
- **Size:** ~15-30 employees (2nd-gen Huetcher family)
- **Founded:** 1971
- **Key People:** John Huetcher (President); Eric Huetcher (Co-operator)
- **Tech Stack:** **Squarespace + Google Forms + M365** -- lightweight tech for sophisticated services (VMI, kitting)
- **Why:** Gap between service sophistication (VMI programs, kitting, custom processing) and tech stack simplicity.

### Harris Welding Supplies
- **Website:** https://harrisweldingsupplies.com/
- **Size:** 11-50 employees
- **Founded:** 1980
- **Key People:** Todd Hancock (Owner)
- **Why:** Gas distribution adds hidden complexity: cylinder tracking, DOT compliance, recertification schedules. 46 years with no digital footprint.

### Wiseway Supply
- **Website:** https://www.wisewaysupply.com/
- **Size:** 51-200 employees, $43.7M, 11 locations
- **Key People:** John Cain (CEO Emeritus); **Marianne Brummett (COO)**; David Windhorn (Pricing Manager)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Constantly changes the punch system"** -- tech churn searching for solutions
  - Indeed: **"Incredibly disorganized due to the intentional lack of staff"**
- **Why:** 11 locations, recent acquisition (Stearns Supply Oct 2023), COO = right buyer. May exceed target size.

### Murphy Supply Company
- **Website:** https://murphy-supply.com/
- **Size:** ~5 employees, 25,000 sq ft warehouse (janitorial supplies)
- **Founded:** 1950 (76 years, 3rd generation)
- **Key People:** **James M. Murphy (Treasurer, j.murphy@murphy-supply.com)**
- **Why:** 5 people managing 25K sq ft warehouse. Beloved owner = succession risk. Processes in people's heads.

### Queen City Restaurant Supply
- **Website:** https://queencityrestaurantsupply.com/
- **Size:** ~5-15 employees, 17,500 sq ft
- **Founded:** 2015
- **Tech Stack:** **Shopify store + separate WordPress website** = disconnected.
- **Why:** Fast-growing since 2015. Shopify orders likely don't sync with inventory or accounting. New/used equipment = dual pricing paradigm.

## Priority 3

### Alcor Supply
- **Website:** https://www.alcorsupply.com/
- **Size:** ~20-49 employees (Dayton/Miamisburg)
- **Key People:** Joe Harrison (President). Women and veteran-owned.
- **Why:** 600 manufacturer relationships. Split facilities. "Poor management worse equipment." Slightly outside Cincinnati core.

### Sunset Janitorial Supply
- **Website:** https://www.sunsetjanitorialsupply.com/
- **Size:** ~6-7 employees
- **Key People:** Amy Hoffman (Owner); Jerry Diers (Owner per LinkedIn)
- **Why:** 6 people doing everything. Dual ownership. Recent BBB accreditation (2022) after 33 years = starting to formalize.

### Cincinnati Piping Supply
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatipipingsupply.com/
- **Size:** ~5-15 employees
- **Founded:** 1977
- **Why:** 49 years, no digital anything. 4 market segments from 1 location. Relationship-driven only.

### Stigler Supply Company ★ NEW
- **Website:** https://www.stiglersupply.com
- **Size:** ~15 employees, ~$5M revenue
- **Founded:** 1969
- **Key People:** John Tenhundfeld (Owner); Beth Glassmeyer (Secretary/Admin); Tricia Rohling (Secretary/Treasurer); Deb Tenhundfeld (family)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic/static website. No e-commerce. Orders via sales reps, phone, possibly fax.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **constantly changing commission structures, goals, and pricing** — signals disorganized internal processes
  - High turnover among sales reps — could indicate lack of CRM or poor onboarding
  - Management lying about overtime and health insurance
  - Field reps + warehouse + delivery = classic operational complexity
  - Family-owned since 1969 — 50+ years of legacy systems
- **Why:** Beth Glassmeyer or Tricia Rohling is the Backbone holding operations together. The constant pricing/commission changes suggest no single source of truth. Field sales + warehouse + delivery coordination for a family business.

### Asad Wholesale Inc. ★ NEW
- **Website:** https://asadwholesale.com
- **Size:** 10-19 employees
- **Founded:** 1998
- **Key People:** Salah Asad (CEO/Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** WooCommerce/WordPress (consumer platform stretched for B2B). Still accepts FAX orders.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Still accepts fax orders** — definitive evidence of manual processes
  - WooCommerce being used for B2B wholesale — not designed for customer-specific pricing, net terms, or purchase orders
  - 9,000+ SKUs managed across phone, fax, and web — high likelihood of inventory discrepancies
  - Convenience store/gas station customers place frequent, small orders expecting fast delivery
  - Family-owned since 1998 with founder still running it
- **Why:** Textbook small distributor outgrowing its tools. 9K SKUs, fax orders, consumer e-commerce stretched for wholesale, and the founder doing everything. The gap between storefront and warehouse operations is causing daily headaches.

### Tri-State Wholesale Building Supplies ★ NEW
- **Website:** https://tri-statewholesale.com
- **Size:** 8 employees
- **Founded:** 1970
- **Key People:** Jason Welch (President); Danny Mickle (Ops Manager - Manufacturing); Matthew Thieken (Ops Manager)
- **Tech Stack:** WooCommerce/WordPress. No sophisticated order/quoting system.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Only 8 employees but they BOTH manufacture AND distribute — enormous complexity for tiny team
  - Serve contractors AND DIY homeowners — two completely different customer types
  - Custom window/enclosure orders require tracking through manufacturing + delivery
  - New headquarters recently built — growth phase stressing existing processes
- **Why:** Two operations managers in an 8-person company tells you operations is complex enough to need dedicated people. Manufacturing + distribution + walk-in sales + contractor accounts. New HQ signals growth. Begging for connected systems.

### Edgeco Wholesale ★ NEW
- **Website:** https://edgcowholesale.com
- **Size:** ~25 employees
- **Founded:** 2003
- **Key People:** Brent Fening (Managing Owner); James P. Fening (President per D&B)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic informational website. No online ordering. Phone and email only.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Google reviews: office workers "extremely rude" — likely overwhelmed, not actually rude
  - Emergency Saturday deliveries = ad-hoc processes with no formal scheduling
  - "One of the last local, independent distributors" — competing against ABC Supply, SRS without their systems
  - Contractor customers expect fast availability and accurate orders
- **Why:** ~25 employees, family-owned roofing/building materials. Overwhelmed office dealing with phone orders and manual processes. Competing against nationals means they need efficiency to survive.

### Trinity Supply LLC ★ NEW
- **Website:** https://trinitysupplyllc.com
- **Size:** ~5-10 employees
- **Founded:** 2017
- **Key People:** Tony Kestel (Co-Owner); Mary Ann Kestel (Co-Owner per BBB)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic WordPress. Likely QuickBooks + spreadsheets.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - DUAL business model: product distribution + construction final clean SERVICES — two different businesses under one roof
  - Founded 2017 and "thriving" — fast-growing young company outgrowing starter tools
  - Cleaning services require job scheduling, crew management, and supply tracking per job site
  - Small enough that Tony and Mary Ann are doing everything
- **Why:** Young, growing company at the stage where getting systems right prevents bad habits from calcifying. The dual ops model (supply + services) creates natural complexity.

### Supply Post Business Products ★ NEW
- **Website:** https://www.supply-post.com
- **Size:** ~9 employees, 7 delivery vehicles
- **Founded:** Early 1980s (as Paperworks, Inc.)
- **Key People:** Jonathan E. Friedmann (President/Owner — took over 2008 after founder's passing)
- **Tech Stack:** ESP Webstore e-commerce + separate marketing website. Two systems.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 40,000+ SKUs with 9 employees — enormous catalog for tiny team
  - Built through acquisitions in the 1990s-2000s — acquired companies bring different systems never fully integrated
  - Owner took over after founder's unexpected passing — business continuity was chaotic, documentation poor
  - 7 delivery vehicles to manage (route optimization, scheduling, driver communication)
  - Furniture installation team adds project management complexity
  - Competes against Amazon Business — operational efficiency is existential
- **Why:** Largest independent office supply dealer in Greater Cincinnati. Post-acquisition, post-founder-death, competing against Amazon with 9 people and 40K SKUs. Dual website (ESP + marketing) suggests systems not well-connected.

### FRY Fastening Systems ★ NEW
- **Website:** https://www.frysys.com
- **Size:** ~23 employees across 3 distribution centers
- **Founded:** 1986
- **Key People:** Greg Burkhart (President/CEO); Phil Burkhart (COO)
- **Tech Stack:** Fry's Nail Gun Depot e-commerce (since 2000) + B2B distribution. Multiple disconnected systems likely.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - THREE separate business lines: product sales, warranty/repair service, and tool rental — each with completely different workflows
  - Three distribution centers = multi-location inventory management
  - Fry's Nail Gun Depot is a separate e-commerce brand/channel — likely running on different system than B2B
  - Tool rental requires asset tracking, maintenance scheduling, rental billing
  - Warranty service requires repair tracking, parts inventory, manufacturer claims processing
- **Why:** Greg Burkhart running three businesses in one across three locations with ~23 people. Data and workflow complexity is massive for this size. Connecting tools and automating handoffs could yield enormous efficiency gains.

### Chrisco Restaurant Design & Supply ★ NEW
- **Website:** https://chriscodesign.com
- **Size:** 2-4 employees, $5-10M revenue
- **Founded:** ~2002
- **Key People:** Chris Ferraro (Owner); Eleni Ferraro (Co-Owner); Trent Heimann (team member)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic website. No e-commerce or online catalog. Phone/email only.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - $5-10M in revenue with 2-4 people — extraordinary throughput per person
  - Design services require project management (drawings, approvals, equipment selection, ordering, installation scheduling)
  - New AND used equipment = two different sourcing and pricing models
  - 4-city service region (Cincinnati, Dayton, Louisville, Lexington) with 2-4 people
- **Why:** Chris and Eleni ARE the operations team. Every process lives in their heads. If Chris gets sick, the business stops. Systematizing quoting, project management, and order tracking would be transformative even if simple.

### Supplier/Distributor Vertical-Wide Themes (updated)

1. **"WooCommerce/Shopify for B2B"** — Asad Wholesale, Tri-State Wholesale, Queen City Restaurant Supply all use consumer e-commerce platforms stretched for wholesale workflows. No customer-specific pricing, net terms, or PO support.
2. **"Walk-in Counter + Delivery"** dual workflow — Sunset Janitorial, Murphy Supply, Tri-State, Phillips Supply, Edgeco, Queen City. Each requires different order processing, rarely sharing a system.
3. **"Family Succession and Ownership Transitions"** — Murphy (3rd gen), Queen City (Foust→Carr), Supply Post (post-founder death), Cincinnati Fastener (2nd gen), Keidel (Winsupply acquisition). Each creates a modernization opportunity.
4. **"Phone/Fax Ordering Persists"** — Asad Wholesale explicitly accepts fax. Sunset, Edgeco, Chrisco appear phone/email-only. Low-hanging fruit for automation.
5. **"The Office Manager Is the Real Backbone"** — Phillips Supply's Joseph Warakomski, Stigler's Beth Glassmeyer and Tricia Rohling, Avsten's Erin Wood. These are the entry points who feel the pain daily.
6. **"Extreme Revenue-to-Staff Ratios"** — Chrisco ($5-10M with 2-4 people), Supply Post (40K SKUs with 9), JB Doppes (157 years of product diversity with 16 people). When everything runs through one or two people's heads, the business is one illness away from crisis.

### Industry Context
**43% of small businesses** don't track inventory or use manual processes, losing up to **11% of annual revenue** to inefficiencies. Typical progression: QuickBooks year 1-3, Excel year 3-5, "patchwork of disconnected systems held together by manual processes" after year 5.

# BLUE COLLAR SERVICES

## Priority 1

### Scherzinger Pest Control
- **Website:** https://stopzbugs.com/
- **Size:** ~50 employees, $7.3M revenue, 3 metro locations (Cincinnati/NKY, Dayton, Columbus)
- **Founded:** 1934 (92 years, 4th generation)
- **Key People:** Steve Scherzinger (CEO, 3rd gen); Kurt Scherzinger (President, 4th gen); Eric Scherzinger (VP Procurement/Marketing, 4th gen); **Bill Brown (Area Operations Manager)**; Mike Wedding (Technical Director)
- **Tech Stack:** No confirmed FSM platform. Phone-heavy inbound model.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: **"My first appointment was a no-show and when I called, it was a scheduling error"**
  - BBB: **"Scherzinger had been billing me without providing service"**
  - BBB: Customer made **"4 calls between January 2024 to April"** and was **"assured a supervisor would call in 48 hours"** -- no callback
  - Customer: Had to **"sit through their on hold bull crap 7 or 8 times"**
  - Indeed: **"Field Support staff was merged with the call center and the work load became unmanageable"**
- **Why:** 90-year-old family business showing clear signs that back-office hasn't scaled. Technicians missing appointments, customers billed for services never rendered, call center merged with field support and "became unmanageable." Routing/scheduling doesn't talk to billing. Bill Brown (Ops Manager) lives in this pain.

### Leaders Moving & Storage
- **Website:** https://www.leadersmoving.com/
- **Size:** ~75-130 employees, 40+ trucks, 4 cities (Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Indianapolis)
- **Founded:** 1994
- **Key People:** Steve (Co-Founder); Craig (Co-Founder); Richie Cox (Dir Ops); Jason (Ops Manager, promoted 2023); **Elaine Morris (Assistant Administrator -- accounting, operations, processes, budgets)**; William Cline (IT, 10+ years)
- **Tech Stack:** Dispatch system is literally a phone number: **"The night before you call a phone number and they tell you if you're scheduled for the next day."**
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Managers mess with ur money and every check will be wrong"**
  - Indeed: **"Working long hard hours with one person when the job should have 4 people"**
  - Indeed: **"There was zero communication internally"**
- **Why:** 40+ trucks across 4 cities with PHONE-CALL dispatch. Payroll wrong "every check." Crews understaffed because nobody tracks job-to-crew ratios. Elaine Morris (budgets + operations) and Jason (Ops Manager) feel this most.

### Eads Fence Company
- **Website:** https://www.eadsfence.com/
- **Size:** ~50 employees, $22M revenue
- **Founded:** 1980 (46 years)
- **Key People:** Dale Eads (Founder/CEO); Charles Pack (President); **Joy (Scheduling, named by customers)**
- **Tech Stack:** No specific software. Manual scheduling/ordering visible in complaint patterns.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: Contract signed May 5, completion not until October 30 -- 6-month fence install
  - BBB: **"Eads did not order enough post, panels or even enough post caps"**
  - BBB: **"Eads failed to have Duke mark where the electrical lines are... wires had been nicked during installation"**
  - BBB: **"After multiple emails and phone calls... they NEVER got back to us"**
  - BBB: **"Maybe one of the worst companies we have ever done business with in our 35+ years of owning homes"**
- **Why:** $22M company with scheduling and project management crisis. Jobs not tracked, materials not ordered correctly, utility pre-work not coordinated, customers can't reach anyone. Good fence work but broken operational wrapper.

## Priority 2

### Wimberg Landscaping
- **Website:** https://wimberglandscaping.com/
- **Size:** 50+ employees, 25+ trucks
- **Founded:** 1980 (46 years, started with 2 employees and 1 truck)
- **Key People:** Peter Wimberg (Founder); John (VP, Finance); **Connie (Office Manager since 1997, 28+ years)**; Brigid Wimberg (Team/Client Dev, since 2020); Samantha (Client Account Manager); Tim (Installation Leader)
- **Pain Signals:** Indeed: **"Communication lacked."** Year-round services (landscaping, snow removal, hardscape, maintenance) = seasonal transition complexity.
- **Why:** Connie has been Office Manager for 28 years -- she IS the institutional knowledge. If Connie has a sick day, the operational knowledge walks out the door. "Prevention" sale rather than "crisis" sale.

### Cincinnati Fleet Care
- **Website:** https://cincinnatifleetcare.com/
- **Size:** ~10-20 employees, 12-bay facility
- **Founded:** 1989 (37 years)
- **Key People:** John (Ops Manager, 30 years industry, 18 years here); **Susan (Office Manager, 20+ years)**; Dean Helcher (Service Manager, 29 years industry, 16 years here); Chris Schneider (Sales Manager/Principal)
- **Why:** Authorized by **8+ national fleet management platforms** (PHH, Element, GE, ARI, Donlen, Wheels, CLP, Enterprise Fleet). Susan toggles between 8+ portals daily. Classic "disconnected software" imposed by customers, not by choice.

### Advanced Mobile Fleet Services
- **Website:** https://advancedmobilefleet.com/
- **Size:** ~10-25 employees, mobile service fleet
- **Founded:** 1993 (33 years)
- **Key People:** Lawrence Torbeck (President)
- **Pain Signals:** Indeed: **"Communication issues"**; **"hours not guaranteed on daily basis"**
- **Why:** Mobile fleet service = dispatch accuracy is everything. Wrong parts, wrong location, wrong timing = wasted trip. Torbeck is a great mechanic running complex logistics.

### Seasons Best Landscaping
- **Website:** https://seasonsbestlandscaping.com/
- **Size:** ~15-30 employees (veteran-owned)
- **Founded:** ~2013
- **Key People:** Jonathan (Owner, veteran); Reilly (PM); Rob Taylor (Team Lead); plus Carlos, Raphael, Amy, Pete, Jeff, Tina
- **Why:** 7+ service lines with seasonal transitions. Growth-stage company where owner is the hub of all ops decisions. Responsiveness that becomes unsustainable as company grows.

### Werbrich's Landscaping
- **Website:** https://cincinnatilandscaping.com/
- **Size:** ~20-40 employees, avg 8-year tenure
- **Founded:** ~2003
- **Key People:** Kevin Werbrich (Owner, 100% CEO approval)
- **Tech Stack:** **Smartphone time tracking confirmed** (ClockShark or similar). But likely not connected to scheduling, CRM, invoicing, job costing.
- **Why:** Started the tech journey (time tracking) but haven't connected it through. Premium $50K+ projects where margin is lost when change orders aren't tracked.

### Robinson Relocations
- **Website:** https://robinsonrelocations.com/
- **Size:** ~15-30 employees, 2 locations, FMCSA licensed
- **Key People:** Brian Robinson (Owner/Founder)
- **Pain Signals:** Reviews: **"Consistently fails, often charging almost double the initially quoted price."**
- **Why:** Quoting vs actual job costing disconnect. Person giving quote doesn't have same info as crew doing work = classic data problem.

### Quality Comfort Home Services
- **Website:** https://www.myqualitycomfort.com/
- **Size:** ~15-30 employees, new warehouse (2023)
- **Founded:** 2011
- **Key People:** Ryan Osterkamp (Owner, started HVAC at 23); Erin Osterkamp (wife/co-owner)
- **Tech Stack:** Text dispatch notifications. Multiple scheduling options (call, text, chat, online).
- **Why:** Growth from 2 to ~25 employees. 1,300+ five-star reviews. BBB Torch Award finalist. At the inflection point where startup tools stop working.

### Pest All Exterminating
- **Website:** https://www.pestallexterminating.com/
- **Size:** ~8-15 employees
- **Founded:** 1968 (58 years, 2nd generation)
- **Key People:** Peter Anderson Sr. (CEO); **Peter Anderson Jr. (President, 2nd gen)**
- **Why:** Generational transition. 58 years of legacy processes. Same-day service with small team = reactive scheduling. Knowledge locked in long-tenure employees' heads.

### Precision Cleaning Systems
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatijanitorialservices.com/
- **Size:** ~5 employees (woman-owned)
- **Founded:** 1997
- **Key People:** Melissa Jent (Owner); Kelly Wilkie (possible co-owner)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Schedule changes occurring daily if not multiple times a day"**
  - Office staff does: phones, emails, estimates, invoices, scheduling, mileage calculations, payments -- all manual
- **Why:** The office staff IS the system. Manual mileage calculation, phone-based scheduling. Basic automation could transform operations.

## Priority 3

### Osterwisch Company
- **Website:** https://www.osterwisch.com/
- **Size:** 84 employees, 4 trade lines (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, refrigeration), NO subcontractors
- **Founded:** 1946 (80 years, 3rd generation)
- **Why:** 84 employees across 4 certified trades with zero subcontractors. Dispatching requires knowing which techs have which certifications. 80 years of tribal knowledge.

### G.I. HAUL Cincinnati
- **Website:** https://www.gihaul.com/cincinnati-oh/
- **Size:** ~5-15 employees (franchise)
- **Key People:** Allan Lynch (Owner, U.S. Army veteran, 4th Infantry Division)
- **Why:** Veteran-owned. Junk removal = unpredictable job sizes and routing. Franchise booking system may not connect to local ops. High mission alignment.

### Cross-Cutting Themes
1. **"Phone Number Dispatch"** -- Leaders Moving tells employees to call a phone number the night before. Scherzinger has customers on hold 7-8 times. Telephone-era tools for logistics operations.
2. **"Billing for Phantom Service"** -- Scherzinger billed for services never delivered. Eads couldn't track material orders vs jobs. Leaders has payroll errors every check. When billing, service, and payroll aren't connected, money falls through cracks.
3. **"Multi-Location/Multi-System"** -- Scherzinger (3 cities), Leaders (4 cities), Fleet Care (8+ fleet portals), Eads (subcontractors) all coordinate across organizational boundaries.
4. **"Generational Transition"** -- Scherzinger (3rd→4th gen), Pest All (1st→2nd gen), Osterwisch (3rd gen), Wimberg (founder active). How to move from "the boss knows everything" to "the system knows everything."
5. **"Reluctant Operator"** -- Robinson (Brian), Quality Comfort (Ryan), Seasons Best (Jonathan), Advanced Mobile (Lawrence), G.I. Haul (Allan) are all founders exceptional at service work but now running complex operations they never trained for.

### Valley Termite & Pest Control
- **Website:** https://www.valleytermiteandpest.com/
- **Size:** ~15 employees, 60+ years in business
- **Key People:** Tami Burkel (Owner/President, NAPW VIP Woman of Year 2014); Mike Burkel (Technician Manager)
- **Tech Stack:** No identifiable FSM or scheduling software. Basic website. No online booking.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Multiple service types (pest control, termite treatment, animal removal, real estate inspections, mold inspections) each with different workflows and pricing models
  - 60-year family business transition — Tami took over from parents, inheriting legacy processes
  - Office hours limited to M-F 8-5, Sat 9-12 with no online scheduling
  - Real estate inspections + commercial pest control are recurring-revenue lines requiring different CRM approaches than residential
  - 5.0 Angi rating — maintaining quality at scale with manual processes is a time bomb
- **Why:** Tami is both owner AND office operations person. Cincinnati's only female-owned full-service pest management company. Running multi-service 60-year-old family business with family help and likely minimal tech.

### Schneller Knochelmann Plumbing Heating & Air
- **Website:** https://www.schnellerair.com/
- **Size:** 52 employees (12 office/sales, 40 field), 34 vehicles, 2 locations (Cincinnati + Covington KY)
- **Key People:** Lisa Knochelmann (Owner & VP, former accountant at CPA firm); Kris Knochelmann (co-owner, field ops)
- **Tech Stack:** No public evidence of ServiceTitan or Housecall Pro. Live agents until 9PM M-F + Saturdays.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Customer reviews mention scheduling callbacks and standby lists — manual or semi-manual scheduling
  - 34 vehicles dispatched across two states (different licensing/regulatory requirements)
  - Summer demand spikes cause "late hours" per Glassdoor
  - Customer complaints about appointment delays without timely updates — field-to-office communication gap
  - 12 office staff plus extended hours = heavy payroll commitment for phone/scheduling
- **Why:** Lisa's accounting background (former CPA firm) means she comes from structured environments and likely sees the operational gaps clearly. Co-purchased business in 2011, running 52 people and 34 trucks across two states. The heavy office staffing (12 people, 9PM hours) suggests process inefficiency.

### Jolly Plumbing Drains Heating & Air ★ HIGH PRIORITY
- **Website:** https://jollyplumbing.com/
- **Size:** 58 employees, 27 technicians, 3 locations, $9.4M revenue
- **Key People:** Brady Jolly (CEO/Owner); Scott Sharrock (Operations Director/COO — BBB customer contact)
- **Tech Stack:** **ServiceTitan** (confirmed) + **custom "Service Jack" reporting tool** built on top. After-hours AI scheduling with human follow-up.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Built custom reporting tool on top of ServiceTitan** — their primary platform doesn't fully meet their data/reporting needs. This is a direct buying signal for integration/optimization work.
  - Indeed reviews: **"highest employee turnover rate of any company I've ever worked for... BY FAR"**
  - Pressure to upsell creates field-vs-office tension
  - 5x revenue growth in a decade across 3 locations — systems that worked at $2M don't work at $10M
  - After-hours AI scheduling + human scheduler = hybrid approach potentially not fully integrated
- **Why:** Rare prospect where we KNOW the exact tech stack AND the specific gap. They use ServiceTitan but needed to build custom tools. That's an invitation for someone who can integrate, extend, and optimize existing tools. Scott Sharrock as Operations Director is the buyer. 2025 Residential Contractor of the Year.

### Delhi Pest Control
- **Website:** https://delhipest.com/
- **Size:** 4-5 employees, new ownership June 2024
- **Key People:** TJ Adams (Owner — took over June 2024)
- **Tech Stack:** Likely just QuickBooks and phone. No online scheduling visible. Limited hours M-F 8-5, Sat 9-12.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Brand new owner inheriting 40+ year old business and its legacy processes
  - 5 employees with 165 years combined experience — knowledge in people's heads, not systems
  - 5.0 Google rating with limited reviews — reputation to protect while modernizing
  - TJ managing every customer interaction personally without online booking
- **Why:** New ownership of established business is ideal timing for ops overhaul. Short window before new owner gets locked into inherited manual processes. Small but potentially very receptive.

### Ohio Building Services (OBS)
- **Website:** https://www.ohiobuildingservices.com/
- **Size:** ~32 employees, ~$5M revenue, founded 1978
- **Key People:** Lina Orr (President); Steven Statman (VP)
- **Tech Stack:** No identifiable scheduling or workforce management software. Wix website.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed reviews: **"goes through managers way too fast"** — manager turnover is a strong ops/process failure signal
  - Employees working only 2 days/week wanting more hours — workforce scheduling and utilization issues
  - Diverse client types (offices, warehouses, schools, medical, fitness, retail) each have different protocols and compliance requirements
  - Owners answering every call directly — bottleneck that doesn't scale
  - No raises, no advancement from within — retention challenges strain thin management layer
- **Why:** Manager turnover problem screams disconnected operations. When managers can't succeed, they often lack the tools. Commercial cleaning across dozens of client sites with different schedules, protocols, and part-time crews is inherently complex. Lina and Steve are drowning in operational details.

### Cougar Electric
- **Website:** https://www.cougarelec.com/
- **Size:** 13+ licensed electricians, commercial/industrial, women-owned
- **Key People:** Chris Elam (President); Mike Tepker (Operations Manager)
- **Tech Stack:** No identifiable PM, FSM, or scheduling software.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Commercial/industrial focus means complex project scheduling, material ordering, permit tracking, and crew management
  - 15,000+ completed jobs with spotless safety record — safety compliance documentation is a massive operational burden
  - BBB "not rated" despite being established since 2005 — limited digital presence suggests limited digital operations
  - Multi-generational family business with 13+ electricians — growth may have outpaced admin infrastructure
- **Why:** Women-owned commercial electrical contractor. Safety/compliance documentation alone is a significant ops burden. Tight-knit family nature means operations knowledge lives in people, not systems.

### iShine Cincy
- **Website:** https://ishinecincy.com/
- **Size:** 1-10 employees, commercial pressure washing + general contracting
- **Key People:** Jacob Gilbert (Owner/Operator, Lakota West HS alumnus)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. No CRM or scheduling visible. BBB accredited A+ since 2020.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Running TWO companies (iShine pressure washing + Cincinnati Affordable Contracting since Dec 2023) with shared resources
  - 1,500+ customers in under 6 years — rapid growth for small crew
  - Commercial focus (apartments, hotels, parking garages) means recurring contracts and multi-site coordination
  - Family-owned with no franchise support — building all systems from scratch
- **Why:** Young entrepreneur juggling two companies with a small team. Split between pressure washing and general contracting means two sets of books, two scheduling systems, shared crews. Growing fast enough to need systems but hasn't had time to build them.

### Blue Collar Vertical-Wide Themes (updated)

1. **"Phone Number Dispatch"** -- Leaders Moving tells employees to call a phone number the night before. Scherzinger has customers on hold 7-8 times. Telephone-era tools for logistics operations.
2. **"Billing for Phantom Service"** -- Scherzinger billed for services never delivered. Eads couldn't track material orders vs jobs. Leaders has payroll errors every check. When billing, service, and payroll aren't connected, money falls through cracks.
3. **"Multi-Location/Multi-System"** -- Scherzinger (3 cities), Leaders (4 cities), Fleet Care (8+ fleet portals), Eads (subcontractors), Jolly (3 locations + ServiceTitan + custom tools), Schneller (2 states) all coordinate across organizational boundaries.
4. **"Generational Transition"** -- Scherzinger (3rd→4th gen), Pest All (1st→2nd gen), Osterwisch (3rd gen), Wimberg (founder active), Valley Termite (parents→Tami), Delhi (new owner 2024). How to move from "the boss knows everything" to "the system knows everything."
5. **"Reluctant Operator"** -- Robinson (Brian), Quality Comfort (Ryan), Seasons Best (Jonathan), Advanced Mobile (Lawrence), G.I. Haul (Allan), iShine (Jacob) are all founders exceptional at service work but now running complex operations they never trained for.
6. **"Known Stack with Known Gaps"** -- Jolly Plumbing is the standout: ServiceTitan user who built custom reporting on top because the off-the-shelf solution isn't enough. This is the dream pitch for integration/optimization work.

# NEXT STEPS

1. **Start with Priority 1 prospects across all verticals** — these have the strongest, most specific pain signals
2. **For each Priority 1 prospect, draft a personalized email** using the pain signal as the opening observation
3. **Community Shares is a strategic play** — if you can help them, you get introduced to 45 progressive nonprofits
4. **SpliceNet Consulting** (law firm IT) — explore whether they're a referral partner or competitor
5. **Track outreach in the CSV** — update Status column as you go
6. **Contact scraping complete** — All 9 verticals now have email/phone/confidence data. 39 CONFIRMED, 63 INFERRED (call to verify before sending), 24 GENERIC, 5 empty (no data found)
7. **Continue growing toward 500** — Currently at 384 prospects across 13 verticals in Cincinnati. Phase C gap-filling complete for Law (+12), Nonprofit (+14), Accounting (+9), Real Estate (+9). Need ~116 more to reach 500.

# BLUE COLLAR SERVICES — BATCH 1 EXPANSION (Landscaping, Tree Service, Pool Service)
### Researched 2026-02-12

## Priority 1

### Seiler's Landscaping
- **Website:** https://www.seilerslandscaping.com/
- **Size:** ~35 employees, $4M revenue (targeting $10M by 2030)
- **Founded:** 1977 by Jim Seiler; Will Seiler (son) purchased Jan 1, 2020
- **Key People:** Will Seiler (Owner, lives in Boulder CO); Dave Parrish (General Manager, runs daily Cincinnati ops); Stacy Flannery (Controller); Greg Kuykendall (Construction Mgr); Elliott Rubin (Maintenance Mgr); Darren Shick, Monica Riordan, Anna Kersker (Sales/Design)
- **Tech Stack:** Aspire (FSM), CompanyCam, Jeffrey Scott's Leaders Edge rolling budget, Squarespace website, MailChimp, Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Owner lives in Boulder, CO — **manages Cincinnati operations remotely, visiting "about three or four days" per month.** Dave Parrish is the de facto operator.
  - Revenue tripled from **$1.5M to $4M** in four years post-acquisition. Systems built at $1.5M are being stretched to handle $4M.
  - **6 open positions** at a 35-person company = attempting to fill **17% of workforce**. Open roles include Project Manager and Office/Admin — signals management layer is insufficient.
  - Will Seiler aims to **"begin acquiring other local service companies"** — M&A without integration infrastructure is an operational time bomb.
  - Purchased the company **January 1, 2020** — weeks before COVID lockdowns. Foundational systems were built under crisis conditions.
  - Aspire Software friction: Will noted **"The trick is choosing the right data to share"** — common Aspire UX complaint about information overload.
  - Shifting from **65% design/build, 35% maintenance to 50/50** — maintenance expansion requires fundamentally different ops (recurring routes, seasonal scheduling, quality audits).
- **Why:** This is the highest-value landscaping prospect on the list. Will Seiler is an engaged, growth-minded owner who already invests in tools (Aspire, CompanyCam, Leaders Edge peer group) — but he's 1,500 miles away trying to manage by monthly data recaps. The gap between his ambitions ($10M, acquisitions, service mix shift) and his current infrastructure ($4M, remote oversight, 17% open headcount) is enormous. Dave Parrish (GM) is the Backbone keeping it all running on-site. The pitch: "The systems that got you from $1.5M to $4M — are those the same systems that get you to $10M while you're managing from Boulder?"

### Paramount Lawn + Landscape
- **Website:** https://www.paramountlandscaping.com/
- **Size:** ~11-50 employees, since 1988
- **Founded:** 1988 by Joe Tekulve (started at age 17)
- **Key People:** Joe Tekulve (Owner/CEO); Shawn Holly (Director of Business Development); Mindy Christman (Property Service Coordinator); Mike Evans (Property Manager)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress website, **Yahoo Mail (ymail.com) as primary business email**, no visible CRM, no FSM, no marketing automation. Field crew used for manual flyer distribution.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed **2.5/5 stars**. Pay/benefits **1.5/5**. Culture **2.0/5**. Job security **2.0/5**.
  - Indeed: **"good pay but long work hours"** and **"No good benefits"**
  - Angi customer complaint: **"One of the guys on the Bobcat during the grading process crashed the machine into the side of my house"** — crew initially hid the incident.
  - Angi: Customer asked for full yard irrigation, **got "less than 2/3rds of the yard watered."** Customer re-seeded **4 times over 11 months** with failures each time.
  - **Yahoo Mail as business email** in 2026 is the single strongest indicator of near-zero tech adoption.
  - 5+ named crew leads across fertilization, irrigation, and landscape divisions coordinating without visible dispatch or FSM software.
- **Why:** 38-year-old family business that has never invested in operational technology. A Yahoo email address, manual flyer distribution by field crew, and quality control failures documented in reviews all point to a company running on phone calls, texts, and tribal knowledge. Joe Tekulve is a classic Reluctant Operator — built the business on personal expertise since age 17 but never professionalized operations. Mindy Christman (Property Service Coordinator) is the Backbone handling scheduling and dispatch almost certainly without proper tools.

### S.B. Tree Service
- **Website:** https://www.sbtreeservice.org/
- **Size:** ~20 employees
- **Founded:** 2021 by Simon Burkey
- **Key People:** Simon Burkey (Founder/Owner); "Chris F" (manager, referenced in complaint responses)
- **Tech Stack:** Squarespace (likely), **Gmail (Sbtreeservicepros@gmail.com)** for business email, Instagram active. No CRM, no FSM.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - ComplaintsBoard: **0% complaint resolution rate** across 3 complaints.
  - Customer: **"hydraulic fluid leaked on driveway from a truck"** — insurance denied, company offered half payment and **threatened to "put a lien on their property"** for non-payment.
  - Customer: Company **"damaged their irrigation system while removing a tree stump by cutting a drip line and burying it without notification, and refused to fix it."**
  - Customer: Company **"coming on property without permission, making ruts with machines and placing ropes on the lawn without obtaining a permit."**
  - **Claims BBB A+ rating on website but is not actually BBB accredited** — credibility risk.
  - **Gmail for a 20-person company** — no professional email infrastructure.
- **Why:** A 4-year-old company that grew to 20 employees fast but without process infrastructure. The complaint pattern (property damage, cover-ups, lien threats, unauthorized access) is textbook "scaling without systems." Gmail as business email, no FSM, no CRM. Simon Burkey is a Reluctant Operator who built the team on hustle but hasn't built the systems to manage quality control, customer communication, or dispute resolution. The BBB credibility gap (claiming a rating they don't have) suggests they don't even have basic compliance/marketing oversight.

### Lefke Tree Experts
- **Website:** https://lefketree.com/
- **Size:** ~10-20 employees
- **Founded:** 2009 (LLC formed 2015)
- **Key People:** Nick Lefke (Founder/Owner); Ben Lefke (Manager, Operations)
- **Tech Stack:** Professional website with blog and review pages. Birdeye for reputation management. LinkedIn active. Professional domain email (office@lefketree.com).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **BBB F Rating.** Failed to respond to 3 complaints filed against the business.
  - Glassdoor: **"They will promise you the world but will never deliver. The lies and deceit never stop."**
  - Glassdoor: **"You are expected to give your entire life to this company and say goodbye to your personal life. They work there guys into the ground, they don't care about safety or there employees."**
  - Glassdoor: **"If you try and take a vacation or ask for time with your family then you risk being demoted or having your pay cut."**
  - Glassdoor: **"The owner burns bridges left and right and is sue happy."**
  - Glassdoor: **"If I could leave them negative stars I would!"**
  - Interview candidate asked **how they "manage stress as a woman"** — potential EEO/discrimination red flag.
  - Currently hiring Tree Service Groundsman/CDL — suggests ongoing turnover.
  - **Contrast:** Customer reviews are positive (5.0 Yelp, 5.0 Angi) — pain is entirely internal.
- **Why:** Deepest employee pain signals in the entire Blue Collar Services vertical. A company where customers love the work but employees are burning out, with safety neglect, retaliation for time-off requests, and a litigious owner. The BBB F rating from unanswered complaints signals a business that either cannot or will not manage its administrative obligations. Enormous upside for ops improvement (HR processes, retention, complaint response systems, scheduling) BUT the owner's described personality ("sue happy," "burns bridges") makes this a high-value/high-risk prospect. Approach with extreme care.

### Don Marcum's Pool Care
- **Website:** https://www.donmarcumspoolcare.net/
- **Size:** ~25 employees, est. $2.5-5M revenue
- **Founded:** 1967
- **Key People:** Don Marcum (President/Founder); Dave Bachman (Vice President); Darlene Marcum (admin/family); Gene Pollack (staff)
- **Tech Stack:** **Yahoo Mail (dmpoolcare@yahoo.com)** for business email. Template website. No CRM, no scheduling software, no FSM. Paper/spreadsheet-based scheduling.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed **2.5/5 stars**, all sub-categories rated **2.0/5**.
  - Indeed: **"Too stressful and management is terrible, co workers are terrible"**
  - Indeed: **"Management could have been better. They are too focused on profit and not enough on customer satisfaction"** — which **"decreases repeat customers and hurts the company's reputation"**
  - Indeed: **"No room for advancement or salary increases"** and **"No good benefits"**
  - Indeed: **"Everyone works separately on different routes so coworkers are seen in the morning but rarely interacted with outside of receiving schedules"** — route workers completely isolated.
  - Angi: **Wrong crew dispatched** to pool opening. Rescheduled appointment **never confirmed, no-show on rescheduled date.**
  - Angi: Heater repair took **four botched attempts** before fix — didn't happen until July. **Receptionist had no records of prior appointments.**
  - Angi: Pool waterfall inoperative **2 months** after opening due to misdiagnosis (blamed valve when it was dirty filters).
  - Pump motor wired incorrectly after replacement. Pool remained unclean despite weekly service charges.
  - Birdeye: **"Will take advantage of you if you don't know much about your pool"**
  - **Not BBB accredited despite being 59 years old** — deliberate choice.
- **Why:** This is the strongest pool service prospect in Cincinnati. A 59-year-old company with ~25 employees running on Yahoo email, with no records of prior appointments, wrong crews dispatched, isolated route workers, and management described as "terrible" and "too focused on profit." The "receptionist had no records of prior appointments" quote is the most damning — it means they are almost certainly running on paper or a basic spreadsheet for scheduling a 25-person route-based service operation. Every one of these failures (misdiagnoses, wrong dispatches, no-shows, lost records) is directly addressable with basic operational systems. Don Marcum is a Reluctant Operator who has run this business for 59 years on personal knowledge and relationships, but the organization has outgrown those methods.

## Priority 2

### Taylor's Tree & Landscaping
- **Website:** https://www.taylorstree.com/ (also taylorstree.net — two separate sites)
- **Size:** ~19 employees, ~$833K revenue
- **Founded:** 1960 by Don and Betty Taylor
- **Key People:** Bruce Taylor (Co-Owner); Craig Taylor (Co-Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** Two separate websites. No public email address — phone-only contact. No evidence of CRM, scheduling, or FSM tools.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed (14-year employee): **"No work through winter months and they lay off half of their employees."**
  - Angi customer: **"Their responsiveness is nonexistent"** regarding a pruning request.
  - Two separate websites (taylorstree.com and taylorstree.net) — classic fragmented digital presence.
  - No public email — phone-based contact only.
  - BBB: insufficient information to issue a rating despite 65 years in business.
- **Why:** A 65-year-old family business that seasonally lays off half its workforce and can't respond to customer inquiries. The dual-website situation, lack of email, and phone-only model signal a company that has never modernized. The seasonal layoff pattern is an operational pain point that better scheduling, service diversification, and financial planning could address. Bruce and Craig Taylor are Reluctant Operators running on inherited processes.

### Allison Landscaping & Water Gardens
- **Website:** https://www.allisonlandscapingandwatergardens.com/
- **Size:** ~11-50 employees
- **Founded:** 1968 by Richard Allison
- **Key People:** Todd Allison (Owner/President); Bob Lake (Co-Owner); Drew Kohn (Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic website. BBB accredited since 1998. No CRM or scheduling visible.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Angi **3.0/5** rating — mixed reviews for a 57-year-old company.
  - Customer complaints about having to **call multiple times** before lawn maintenance was scheduled — overgrown lawn waiting for service.
  - Multiple ownership/owner structure (Todd Allison, Bob Lake, Drew Kohn) — three-owner decision complexity.
- **Why:** A third-generation landscaping company with water garden specialization and a retail Outdoor Design Center. The mixed Angi rating and responsiveness complaints suggest scheduling and customer communication gaps. Three owners and a retail + service + design business model create coordination complexity. Member of Ohio Nursery Landscape Association, National Association of Pond Professionals, and BBB. Cincinnati West Side (River Road). Moderate pain signals — the responsiveness issue is the hook.

### Mid-American Gunite Pools
- **Website:** https://midamericanpools.com/
- **Size:** 60+ employees (upper edge of target)
- **Founded:** 1985
- **Key People:** Patrick M. Brennan (Co-Founder); Timothy Buechel (Co-Founder/Co-Owner); Michael B. Geers (Co-Owner); John S. Browner (Co-Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress, Paylocity (HR/recruiting), professional domain email. More tech-mature than peers.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Hiring 7 roles simultaneously** including 3 critical ops positions: Customer Experience Coordinator, Business Office Manager, Pool Service Manager.
  - CX Coordinator job description reveals current gaps: lead qualification, client touchpoint management, permit tracking, record maintenance — all currently falling through the cracks.
  - 4 co-owners = decision complexity.
- **Why:** At 60+ employees, they're at the upper edge of the target range but the operational signals are strong. Hiring a Business Office Manager AND CX Coordinator AND Pool Service Manager simultaneously means either rapid growth or turnover in critical operations roles. The CX Coordinator job description reads like a wish list of things currently being dropped. They have budget (100% company-paid healthcare, 401k match, $29-40/hr field wages) and use Paylocity, so they're not tech-allergic. Erlanger KY HQ, serve OH/KY/IN/WV. BuildZoom top 8% of Ohio contractors.

### Oasis Turf & Tree
- **Website:** https://www.oasisturf.com/
- **Size:** ~20-40 employees
- **Founded:** ~2003
- **Key People:** Rob Reindl (Owner); Adam Zellner (VP of Sales)
- **Tech Stack:** BBB accredited. Website with blog and careers page. No specific FSM identified.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor (mostly positive, 4.5/5, 89% recommend) BUT one review describes Sales Manager who would **"yell constantly at employees, throw things"** and **"manipulate numbers."**
  - 44 reviews on Indeed — company is well-known enough to generate feedback.
- **Why:** Mostly well-run company (4.5 Glassdoor, 89% recommend), but the one management signal about a Sales Manager who "yells constantly" and "manipulates numbers" is severe. Loveland OH. Serves Cincinnati, Dayton, and Northern Kentucky. If the sales management toxicity is real and ongoing, it points to a process/accountability gap where one bad manager can poison the culture because there are no systems-based performance metrics to counter personal manipulation.

## Priority 3

### Dave & Aaron Stang's Certified Tree Care
- **Website:** https://www.davestangscertifiedtreecare.com/
- **Size:** ~20+ employees, 7 certified arborists
- **Founded:** 2003
- **Key People:** Aaron Stang (Owner/Principal); Kristen Stang (Co-Owner); Dave Stang (Co-Founder)
- **Tech Stack:** AWS hosting, OpenSRS email, jQuery. No CRM or FSM visible. No public email despite having hosted email.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Company acknowledged missed callbacks: **"We couldn't apologize enough... we pride ourselves on returning calls the day they come in, but occasionally a call falls through the cracks."**
  - Geographic constraint complaints — customer homes 45 minutes from shop.
  - No negative employee reviews found.
- **Why:** A well-run, BBB-accredited family business with mild pain signals. The admitted "calls falling through the cracks" is a conversation opener about CRM/scheduling tools, but urgency is low. 130+ years combined staff experience, Porch 4.74/5 (47 reviews). Loveland OH. Lower priority — revisit if other prospects don't convert.

### Acme Tree & Landscape Service
- **Website:** https://www.acmetreeandlandscape.com/
- **Size:** ~10-20 employees
- **Founded:** 1940 (85 years, four generations)
- **Key People:** Rita V. Griffin (President, 4th generation)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress with basic JSON feature. No public email. No CRM or FSM.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 85-year-old company with minimal digital footprint — only 8 Google reviews after 85 years.
  - Phone-only contact model. No public email address.
  - ISA, ONLA, TCIA memberships but no tech investment visible.
- **Why:** A quintessential Reluctant Operator scenario — a 4th-generation family tree service that runs on institutional knowledge and relationships. Rita V. Griffin has inherited 85 years of processes that almost certainly live in people's heads, not in systems. The lack of any digital presence after 85 years is itself the pain signal. West Side Cincinnati. Small, traditional, and likely resistant to change, but a succession planning conversation could open the door.

### Disqualified (This Batch)
- **Evans Landscaping** — Owner Doug Evans sentenced to 21 months federal prison for wire fraud (2018). Disqualified for business integrity.
- **Upscale Lawncare & Property Maintenance** — 101-500 employees, too large for target range.
- **GroundsPRO** — Acquired by Visterra Landscape Group (PE-backed national platform, top-30 US) in January 2024. Decision-making no longer local.
- **Aquamarine Pools** — ~5 employees (floor of target range) and problems are character-based (material substitution, paid fake reviews) not operational. Pass.
- **Queen City Pool Pros** — Too new (~5 years), too small (<10 employees), no visible pain. Co-owned by former Bengals linebacker Rey Maualuga.
- **Richey Tree Service** — Likely <5 employees, 85-year ultra-traditional family operation. Too small.

---

# BLUE COLLAR SERVICES — BATCH 2 EXPANSION (Painting, Restoration, Cleaning, Pest Control)

## Priority 1

### Hartman Painting Company
- **Website:** https://www.hartmanpaintingcompany.com/
- **Size:** ~15-30 employees, ~$4M revenue, residential + commercial painting
- **Founded:** 1987 (39 years)
- **Key People:** Wayne Hartman (President/Owner); Connie Hartman (Co-Owner, wife); Lauren Hartman (Office Manager, daughter, UC Industrial Management '18); Wayne Hartman II (Foreman, son); Scott Kelly (Senior Estimator); Robert Irwin (Painter Foreman)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress with Gravity Forms. @fuse.net email (!). Google Analytics. Google reCAPTCHA. Kemba Credit Union financing partner (manual third-party). No CRM, scheduling, estimating, or PM software visible. Job postings mention zero software requirements. Procore network listing (free directory, not software user).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed (former employee): **"Run by an old hardass that never really got around to running it correctly. Constant disputes between owner and management. Constant issues with sore coworkers."**
  - Indeed (former employee): **"Expected to shell out personal money for gas, vehicle wear and tear, and tools."**
  - Angi (customer): **"The painting crews are unusually well-organized with a senior crew member in supervisory capacity"** — customers see organization, employees see chaos. Perception gap = management problem.
  - Business email is hartmanpainting@fuse.net — Cincinnati Bell/Altafiber legacy ISP email. Not a business domain. Major non-cloud indicator.
- **Why:** The strongest painting prospect in the batch. Wayne Hartman has been running this company for 39 years and the "old hardass" review plus "constant disputes between owner and management" paint a clear picture of resistance to change at the top. But the crucial detail is daughter Lauren Hartman — UC 2018 graduate with an Industrial Management degree — now stepping into the Office Manager role. This is the textbook Backbone persona with the education and generational motivation to modernize. She is the champion. The company runs on phone calls, fuse.net email, and painters paying for their own gas and tools (zero expense management, fleet tracking, or tool inventory). BBB A+. Ashburn Rd Cincinnati.

### M&J Painting Ohio
- **Website:** https://www.mandjpaintingohio.com/ (also https://mandjpaintingkentucky.com/)
- **Size:** ~7 employees, ~$1-2M revenue, residential + commercial painting
- **Founded:** ~2017 (LLC incorporated 11/15/2018)
- **Key People:** Mike Burwell (Owner); Bill [last name unknown] (Project Supervisor)
- **Tech Stack:** Personal Gmail (Mburwell9@gmail.com) as primary business email. Two separate websites for OH and KY. Instagram @mjpaintingllc. No CRM, scheduling, or PM software.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed (1 star): **"Being betrayed by a company you bent over backwards for. Being lied to after they betrayed you for 10 months. Countless broken promises."**
  - Indeed: **"Work environment and culture like at the company... Absolutely disgusting. Every employee is out to get the other one."**
  - Indeed: **"Working as hard as you can to get a job done in almost an impossible time for minimum pay in that current industry."**
  - Birdeye (customer, 5.0/5): **"M&J were wonderful to work with from start to finish. Always available to answer any of our questions."** — 5-star customer experience masking 1-star employee experience.
- **Why:** The extreme contrast between 5-star customer reviews and toxic employee culture is the classic sign of a company delivering well externally but falling apart internally. Mike Burwell clearly cares about customer satisfaction but has built zero systems to manage employees. Operating across two states with two separate websites and a personal Gmail as the business email shows zero operational infrastructure. "Impossible time for minimum pay" suggests no job costing, poor scheduling, thin margins pushed onto workers. "Broken promises" = verbal-only management with no documented policies. Florence KY + Cincinnati OH.

### Teasdale Fenton Cleaning & Property Restoration
- **Website:** https://www.teasdalefenton.com/
- **Size:** ~56 employees, $13-18M revenue, 65+ trucks, restoration + carpet cleaning
- **Founded:** Brand heritage since 1830s; current owner Jim Olmstead's family since 1940; pivoted to restoration 2007
- **Key People:** Jim Olmstead (Owner); Leah Olmstead (Owner/VP/Office Manager — triple title, Jim's wife); Hunter Olmstead (General Manager, Jim's son); Adem Brooks (VP); Troy Purdin (VP Cleaning Operations); Stacey Zanders (Mitigation Manager); Jacob Emerson (Reconstruction Division Manager); John Fout (HR Manager); Sierra Fields (Marketing Director); Shelly DeGeorge (Accounting Manager); Chris Von Nida (Controller)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. Contact Form 7. No FSM, CRM, or customer portal visible. Phone-based intake. No online scheduling. 23+ active job postings on Indeed at any time. Actively hiring CSRs, estimators, carpenters, floor techs.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Awful management. No communication between departments."**
  - Indeed: **"No organization & the management does not do anything to help you succeed."**
  - Glassdoor: **"Divisions within the company are dysfunctional."**
  - Glassdoor: **"Lack of clear and concise communication and expectations from management and ownership."**
  - Glassdoor: **"Upper Management is confusing, they have meetings all the time but can not provide basic information that was asked."**
  - BBB complaint: **"The job was not fulfilled, dates were not followed through with, and messages were not replied to — out of our house for over four months."**
  - BBB complaint: **"The restoration team was horrific and the project manager was unresponsive and eventually fired."**
  - BBB complaint (Nov 2024): **"A basement water damage repair project took over a year to complete due to employee and contractor firings, incompetence, and ordering the wrong materials."**
- **Why:** The highest pain-signal density of any prospect in Batch 2. A company with 56 employees, 65+ trucks, and $13-18M in revenue that has zero visible operations technology. Employee reviews across both Indeed and Glassdoor converge on the same theme: departments don't communicate, divisions are dysfunctional, and management can't provide basic information. The BBB complaints confirm this internally — a basement restoration that took over a year, a PM fired mid-project, customers displaced for months. Leah Olmstead's triple title (Owner/VP/Office Manager) signals stretched leadership. Hunter Olmstead as GM suggests succession planning but also generational tension. Expanding into Columbus and Dayton adds even more coordination complexity. BBB A+ since 2008. Centron Pl Cincinnati.

### Brock Restoration
- **Website:** https://www.brockrestoration.com/
- **Size:** ~11-25 employees, ~$5M revenue, water/fire/mold restoration
- **Founded:** 1999 (27 years)
- **Key People:** Gary Brock (Owner); Christine Dattilo (Office Manager); Heather Prijatel (Director of Marketing & Events); Joe Smallwood (Senior Estimator)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. Cloudflare CDN. No FSM, CRM, or customer portal. Basic contact form. No online scheduling or status tracking.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB complaint: **"The project management on the job was horrendous."**
  - BBB complaint: **"The project manager even told me someone on his crew told him to just lie to me about something being completed because 'I would never notice.'"**
  - BBB complaint: **"His scheduling was awful. Three times we scheduled they just did not show up at all — I had to reach out hours or a day after the scheduled date and ask why they weren't here."**
  - Indeed: **"No room for growth, no management, lots of nepotism within the company."**
  - Indeed: **"Pay is far below identical jobs in the same industry."**
- **Why:** The scheduling no-shows and crew lying about completed work are the most visceral pain signals in the restoration category. Three no-shows in a single customer engagement, crew members being told to just lie about work completion — these are not abstract process failures, they are concrete, documented breakdowns in field-to-office communication. A 27-year-old company with ~20 employees running 24/7 emergency response across Cincinnati, NKY, SE Indiana, and Dayton without any visible dispatch or project management software. Christine Dattilo (Office Manager) is the Backbone. BBB accredited. Cleves OH.

### Dry Effect
- **Website:** https://dryeffect.com/
- **Size:** ~8-11 employees, ~$13M revenue, water/mold/fire restoration
- **Founded:** 2013 (13 years)
- **Key People:** Josh McIntyre (Owner/Co-Owner); Lisa McIntyre (Co-Owner, UC Applied Science); Roberta Kraus (Office Manager); Nick Alley (Supervisor, 9+ years tenure)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. Xactimate (insurance estimating). No FSM, CRM, or customer portal. No online scheduling. IICRC certified. Contact form only.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - $13M revenue with 8-11 employees = ~$1.3M revenue per employee. Industry average for restoration is $150-250K/employee. Extreme strain or heavy subcontracting.
  - Glassdoor (current employee): **"The schedule is a little different than a normal job"** because they **"have to base their time around customers."**
  - Website claims BBB A+ rating but BBB profile shows NOT accredited — credibility/compliance gap.
  - Job postings seek candidates who share "Christian values" and post on ChristianJobs.com — faith-based hiring may limit an already-small candidate pool.
  - Multiple active job postings across Indeed, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, and company website simultaneously = can't hire fast enough.
- **Why:** The revenue-to-headcount ratio is the most extreme outlier in the entire prospect database. $13M with 8-11 people means either massive subcontractor reliance, severely stretched staff, or insurance claim pass-through inflating the number. Any scenario means operational complexity far beyond what a manual phone-and-paper operation can handle. Nick Alley (9-year supervisor) represents a dangerous bus factor — institutional knowledge concentrated in one person. Roberta Kraus (Office Manager) is the Backbone. 234 Google reviews at 4.9 stars with this tiny team = demand massively outpacing capacity. Hopkins St Cincinnati.

### CMC Commercial Cleaning (Custom Maid Cleaning Service)
- **Website:** https://www.cmccommercialcleaning.com/
- **Size:** 50+ employees, ~$2-4M revenue, commercial janitorial + floor + window cleaning
- **Founded:** 1976 (50 years)
- **Key People:** Walter "Walt" Ford (President/Owner since 1980); Mrs. Ford (Founder, Walt's mother)
- **Tech Stack:** AOL email (wford5@aol.com) as primary business contact. Basic template website. No scheduling/dispatch software. No client portal. No ATS — careers page is a basic HTML form. No social media presence. LinkedIn profile has company name typo: "custom Maid Cleaning Sevice."
- **Pain Signals:**
  - AOL email address for a 50+ employee company. This is not a figure of speech — the business email on BBB, directories, and LinkedIn is wford5@aol.com.
  - 50+ cleaning crews dispatched across Cincinnati and NKY with phone calls and an AOL inbox.
  - Careers page asks applicants to "fill out an employment form" via a basic web form — no applicant tracking.
  - Walt Ford has been running this company since 1980 (45+ years). No visible succession plan. No second-generation leadership, no COO, no operations manager mentioned anywhere.
  - "No contracts or termination fees" model = high customer churn risk without CRM.
- **Why:** The AOL email alone makes this one of the most tech-lagging prospects in the entire database. Walt Ford, a UC graduate who has run this company for 45 years, coordinates 50+ cleaners across multiple commercial sites using phone calls and AOL. The careers page is a basic HTML form. There is no named person in the entire company other than Walt — across all public sources, LinkedIn, BBB, directories, nobody else appears. This is the definition of a single point of failure running a 50-person operation. The question is whether Walt, likely in his late 60s or 70s, is open to modernization or winding down. BBB A+ accredited. Burwood Ave Cincinnati.

### Hall-Mark Premier Cleaning
- **Website:** https://hall-markpremiercleaning.com/
- **Size:** ~15-25 employees, residential + commercial cleaning
- **Founded:** ~1995 (30+ years)
- **Key People:** Jan Hall (Jeanine M. Hall) — Owner. No other named personnel found anywhere.
- **Tech Stack:** Template website. No online booking. No published email address. Phone-only contact model. No ATS. Employees use personal vehicles — no fleet management, no route optimization, no GPS tracking. Publishes content on Issuu (unusual).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Jan will also make you work off the clock."** — FLSA wage/hour violation risk.
  - Indeed: **"No paid holidays, no paid personal leave, will tell you you can earn tips, but you see hardly any."**
  - Indeed: **"Everyone that works there is either a relative of the owner Jan or a good friend of hers."**
  - Indeed: **"Jan shows no respect for any employee who she isn't related to."**
  - Customer complaint: Quoted $800 for deep clean, charged $2,200. Nearly 3x overrun = no standardized estimating.
  - Same customer: Cleaners broke a vanity light, scraped paint off fireplace, ruined a TV cabinet with wrong cleaner — all in one job. No damage incident reporting or resolution process.
  - 6 open job postings for a ~20-employee company = ~30% vacancy rate.
- **Why:** The Indeed reviews paint a picture of a company with serious internal dysfunction. Off-the-clock work is an FLSA liability. Favoritism toward relatives creates a toxic culture for non-family employees. The $800-to-$2,200 billing overrun shows no standardized estimating or scope-of-work documentation. Property damage without proper handling shows no incident reporting process. The 30% vacancy rate confirms the culture problems are driving turnover. Jan Hall appears to be the sole decision-maker with no operations manager, office manager, or team lead identified anywhere — coordinating 900+ properties and 20+ employees as a single person. Ohio Pike Cincinnati. Not BBB accredited.

### Perfection Pest Control
- **Website:** https://www.perfectionpest.com/
- **Size:** ~14 employees, ~$4M revenue, pest control + wildlife + termite
- **Founded:** 1998 (28 years)
- **Key People:** Tim Leatherman (President/Founder, 44+ years pest management, NPMA Board member); Branch Manager (Army Reserve Veteran, 9 years); Technicians: Denny, Doug, Vic, Russ
- **Tech Stack:** Modern template website with "Pick Your Plan" service tiers. Dual websites (perfectionpest.com + cincinnatipestcontrolservices.com for Perfection Residential brand). No online booking or customer portal. No FSM visible. Phone and web form only.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Acquired Responsible Services (pest control company in northern Cincinnati to southern Dayton corridor). Tim Leatherman stated: **"[Responsible Services] fits into Perfection Pest Control's growth plans into the northern Cincinnati to southern Dayton area."** Integrating routes, customers, and processes into a 14-person operation = significant strain.
  - Tri-state licensing across OH, KY, and IN — managing renewals, continuing education, and state-specific compliance documentation across 3 states with 14 people.
  - Tim Leatherman is NPMA Board member, QualityPro certified, Angie's List Super Service Award x3, active in P.E.S.T. Relief International charity — frequently absent for industry leadership events. Who runs the shop?
  - BBB has "insufficient information to issue a rating" despite 28 years in business — administrative neglect.
  - Angi reviews note pricing "higher than expected, leading to mixed feelings about value for money" — possible quoting inconsistency.
  - No Office Manager or Ops Manager publicly identified — Tim likely manages both field operations and back-office.
- **Why:** A growing company actively acquiring competitors and expanding geographically with only 14 people and no visible operations technology. Tim Leatherman is an industry veteran with board-level connections who understands best practices but may not have operationalized them internally. The acquisition integration, tri-state licensing burden, dual websites, and absence of any identified office manager make this a textbook case of operational strain outpacing infrastructure. Tim is the Reluctant Operator who built the business on expertise and reputation but now needs systems. QualityPro certified. Union KY.

### Sure Thing Pest Control
- **Website:** https://surethingpc.com/
- **Size:** ~12 employees, $2-4M revenue, pest + termite + mosquito + wildlife
- **Founded:** ~1997 (28 years)
- **Key People:** Jerry Zapf (Co-Owner, 30+ years pest experience); Glenn Scherzinger (Co-Owner/President, also runs Showcase Turf & Tree and a Christmas Lighting Company); unnamed Operations Manager (confirmed via Indeed)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress with dedicated SEO content pages for each pest type and service area. Strong SEO investment but zero operations technology. No online booking or customer portal. No FSM. Phone and email only.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB C+ rating due to **"failure to respond to 1 complaint filed against the business."** No admin process for monitoring external communications.
  - Indeed (Operations Manager, current): **"Relaxed atmosphere with realistic expectations"** and **"freedom to schedule and set your pace"** — technicians self-route with no central dispatch. Zero route optimization.
  - Indeed (Technician, current, 2.0/5): Works **part-time at 10 hours per week** with a 30-minute commute — underutilization or inability to fill a full route.
  - Glenn Scherzinger simultaneously runs Sure Thing, Showcase Turf & Tree, AND a Christmas Lighting Company — attention split across 3+ businesses.
  - Glenn Scherzinger shares surname with ScherZinger Pest Control family (Steve/Kurt Scherzinger, ~50+ employees, $20-50M). Competitive pressure from larger family operation or eventual acquisition target — either way, operational efficiency is critical.
- **Why:** A 12-person company generating $2-4M where technicians self-route ("freedom to schedule and set your pace"), one co-owner runs three businesses simultaneously, and the company failed to even respond to a BBB complaint. The Indeed review from a tech working only 10 hours/week at this company is a scheduling red flag — either routes aren't optimized or there's a seasonal capacity mismatch. The Angie's List Super Service Award 13 years running proves service quality; it's the back-office that's lagging. The Scherzinger family connection adds interesting dynamics — they either need to become more efficient to compete independently or maximize value for acquisition. Blue Ash OH.

## Priority 2

### Fritts Painting & Carpentry
- **Website:** https://www.frittspainting.com/
- **Size:** ~5-15 employees, ~$500K-1.5M, residential painting + carpentry
- **Founded:** 1986 (40 years)
- **Key People:** Brian Fritts (President/Owner); Michael Fritts (President, likely father or brother — from "& Son" era)
- **Tech Stack:** Website with CloudFlare. Business domain email (bfritts@frittspainting.com — slightly more mature than Hartman's @fuse.net). Alignable profile. No CRM, scheduling, or PM software.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Angi: **"The end result was sloppy and unprofessional... Fritts didn't manage their time and it became a rush job."**
  - Angi: **"After four weeks and many canceled appointments, I was finally able to get Brian out to their home for needed touchups."**
  - No Indeed employer profile — does not use Indeed for recruiting, likely word-of-mouth/direct hiring.
- **Why:** The scheduling complaints are the most directly documented of any painting prospect. "Didn't manage their time" and "four weeks and many canceled appointments" explicitly describe the consequences of lacking scheduling software. Brian Fritts is the single point of contact for estimates, project oversight, and follow-up visits — classic owner-does-everything bottleneck. Formerly "Fritts Painting & Son" suggesting generational transition already happened. 40-year family business. BBB A+ since 2010. Norwood OH.

### Queen City Painting and Decorating
- **Website:** https://queencitypd.com/ (also https://premium.queencitypd.com/)
- **Size:** ~10-20+ employees, ~$1-3M, residential + commercial painting
- **Founded:** ~2016-2018 (BBB accredited since 11/15/2021)
- **Key People:** Will Patrick (Founder/Owner); David Purtell (Co-Founder)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress with Avada theme. Gravity Forms. WooCommerce (unusual for painting — possibly deposits/product sales). Google Tag Manager. Placeholder text ("COMPANYPHONE" and "COMPANYNAME") still on website. LinkedIn 22 followers. PCA member. Background checks and drug screening for painters.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Angi (1 star): **"The painting crew was the laziest and sloppiest I have ever seen."** Customer listed extensive damage: **"paint on bed sheets, paint on shower curtains, broken floor register, paint on the entrance chandelier, paint on bathroom vanity, paint on carpet, paint on shower tiles, paint on blinds, paint on cabinets, and paint on windows."**
  - Website still has placeholder text in multiple places — incomplete technology execution.
  - Premium service tier (premium.queencitypd.com) suggests upmarket ambitions outpacing systems.
- **Why:** The most growth-oriented painting prospect. Will Patrick and David Purtell are younger founders who explicitly said they "recognized downfalls in contract work" and wanted to change the industry. They're at the inflection point (10-20+ employees, Chamber says 20+) where operational tools become critical. The property damage incident is exactly what happens when a painting company scales beyond what owners can personally supervise. Founders may be the most receptive to ops improvement — they started the company to fix industry problems. Website placeholder text shows they're trying to implement technology but executing imperfectly. BBB A. Wayland Ave Cincinnati.

### Yeti Restoration
- **Website:** https://yetirestoration.com/
- **Size:** ~6-10 employees, <$1M estimated (likely understated), water/fire/mold restoration
- **Founded:** 2015 (~10 years)
- **Key People:** James Baldwin (Founding Yeti/President); Christina Baldwin (Co-Owner); Matt Heinbaugh (Chief Yeti/Owner); Jessica Hammons (Operations Manager); Vicki D'Orazio (Office Manager); Gary Geiman (President & CEO); Adam Ping (Support Manager)
- **Tech Stack:** Template website (likely Squarespace). Older WordPress blog at yetirestoration.wordpress.com. No FSM, CRM, or customer portal. No online scheduling. IICRC certified.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB review: **"I can't say enough about how incompetent Yeti was when performing work on my house."**
  - 6-10 employees serving both Cincinnati AND Dayton = extremely thin for 24/7 restoration
  - "No subcontracting" policy means ALL work handled internally — every job = direct scheduling pressure
  - 248 Google reviews at 4.9 stars with only 6-10 people = demand far outpacing team size
  - Customer reviews consistently name specific technicians (Matt, Mike) — institutional knowledge concentrated in 2-3 people
  - Complex ownership structure: 7 titled people but only 6 employees listed — company has grown beyond database estimates
  - Two addresses (Canal Rd Cincinnati + Brooklyn Ave Milford) — possible office move or dual locations
- **Why:** The "no subcontracting" policy combined with two metro markets and a tiny team guarantees scheduling chaos. Every emergency call must be handled by their own crew, with no overflow capacity. 248 reviews in 10 years shows a growing customer base that's outpacing the team. The ownership structure complexity (Founding Yeti, Chief Yeti, President & CEO — all different people) suggests either a partnership, recent leadership changes, or growth bringing in new management. Jessica Hammons (Operations Manager) and Vicki D'Orazio (Office Manager) are the ones living the daily coordination pain. Founded after James and Christina Baldwin's own home flooded.

### VesCo Residential Cleaning
- **Website:** https://www.vescocleaning.com/
- **Size:** ~15-25 employees, ~$500K-1.5M, residential + light commercial cleaning
- **Founded:** 2008 (18 years)
- **Key People:** Jeremy Vesper (Owner/Founder); Michael Vesper (President, Jeremy's son); Stephen Vesper (Co-Founder, Jeremy's other son); Senior Managers: May, Sonni, Amy; Managers: Valerie, Cassie, Debbie
- **Tech Stack:** Modern template website with "Book Now" button (likely phone/email redirect). Generic shared email (mycleanhome@vescocleaning.com). Twitter @VescoCleaning. LinkedIn company page. No scheduling/dispatch software, no client portal, no fleet management.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"The position is stressful and requires most of one's work week, with hours expected to work going way beyond the normal 8 hours."**
  - Indeed: **"Teams are said to be off at 5pm, but at least half the time teams are out well past 8pm at night and don't get compensated."**
  - Angi (negative): **"They were not professional. They estimated 3.5-4.5 hours but only finished the upstairs, with dust and grime remaining everywhere."**
  - Active hiring for cleaners and managers = ongoing turnover.
- **Why:** The Indeed reviews explicitly describe teams working past 8pm when scheduled off at 5pm without compensation — this is a dispatch/scheduling optimization problem AND a potential FLSA wage/hour liability. Started as a father-and-sons operation, now has 6+ named managers and multiple daily teams. This is the inflection point where manual coordination (phone, texts, whiteboard) breaks down. Quality inconsistency across teams (some customers rave, others report dust everywhere) indicates no standardized checklists or quality tracking. Faith-based. All W-2 employees. BBB A accredited. Maineville OH. Recommended by Coldwell Banker and Sibcy Cline.

### Tailored Home Solutions
- **Website:** https://tailoredhomesolutions.net/
- **Size:** ~10-30 employees (Glassdoor: 1-50), residential + commercial cleaning
- **Founded:** ~2018-2019 (BBB accredited since 3/16/2020)
- **Key People:** Kelly Klein (Owner, 15+ years cleaning industry experience)
- **Tech Stack:** Modern website. Generic support email (support@tailoredhomesolutions.net). No scheduling/dispatch software. No client portal. No online booking. Contact form + phone only.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB complaint: Customer reported damage to shower tile where **"pieces of black tile were crumbling after cleaning."** Customer received **"passive aggressive excuses and lack of accountability."** Company offered $165 free cleaning for ~$1,000 in repairs.
  - Birdeye 4.9/5 (213 reviews) vs Angi 3.0/5 — massive rating disparity. Suggests either selective review solicitation, inconsistent quality, or platform-specific issues.
  - 2,000+ cleaning projects in ~6 years = rapid growth trajectory
  - Cross-state operations (Cincinnati OH + Fort Thomas KY) adds routing, tax, and labor law complexity
- **Why:** Growing fast — 2,000+ projects in 6 years from a startup. Kelly Klein has deep industry experience (15+ years) and runs a positive workplace culture (Indeed reviews are generally positive). But the damage claim handling failure reveals no formal incident tracking or resolution workflow, and the rating disparity across platforms suggests quality control gaps. The cross-state operations add complexity a small team may not be equipped to handle manually. NKY Chamber member. Woman-owned. Fort Thomas KY.

## Updates to Existing Entries

### Pest All Exterminating (UPGRADED from 2-MED to 1-HIGH)
- **Critical New Finding:** Founder Peter T. Anderson Sr. **passed away in March 2025**. He created Pest-All in 1968 and purchased it in 1979. Funeral held March 7-8, 2025 at Geo. H. Rohde & Son Funeral Home, Mount Lookout. Survived by wife Jeanne, son Peter Jr. (Tracy), daughter Lorie Rumsey (Joe), and 5 grandchildren.
- **Impact:** Peter Jr. is now running a 58-year-old business alone that was built on his father's personal relationships and institutional memory. The founder was reportedly still involved until recently ("allowing his father to step back"). Multiple employees with 20+ year tenure — all processes live in their heads. After losing the founder, this institutional knowledge risk is acute.
- **Additional Findings:** Route technician Adam McPherson runs "Critter Combat LLC" as a side business (wildlife removal) — may indicate he feels undercompensated or sees uncaptured opportunity. Doug Smith identified as Sales Inspector. Fax number still prominently listed on website. BBB A+ since 1991. Norwood Chamber member.
- **Why Upgraded:** The founder's death less than a year ago is the single most significant pain signal. The window of receptivity to operational change is open right now — Peter Jr. must operationalize what was informal and relationship-based.

### Delhi Pest Control (UPGRADED from 3-MED to 2-MED)
- **Critical New Finding:** TJ Adams is actively hiring licensed technicians with full benefits (medical insurance, 401k, vacation, sick time). For a 5-person company to offer these benefits signals aggressive growth ambitions.
- **Additional Findings:** Business reincorporated as "Project Bug, LLC" on 3/28/2024. BBB accreditation obtained 4/7/2025 (10 months after purchase). 4.9/5 on Birdeye with 183 reviews. Technicians named in reviews: Barry, Jim, Tom, Bob. Previously owned by Bob & Diana Grinkemeyer since 1982. Bob served on the County Advisory Board.
- **Why Upgraded:** New ownership (8 months ago) + active hiring with benefits = growth-mode company in the optimal receptivity window. TJ hasn't yet calcified into "the way we've always done it" and is investing seriously.

### Disqualified (This Batch)

**Painting:**
- **CertaPro Painters, Five Star Painting, WOW 1 DAY PAINTING, That 1 Painter, 360 Painting, Paint Corps, Painter1, Fresh Coat** — National franchises. Explicitly excluded.
- **Pete Arnold & Company** — ~6 employees, ~$250K revenue. @cinci.rr.com personal ISP email. HTTP-only website (no HTTPS). 30+ years, approaching retirement. Too small and low-revenue for meaningful engagement. No succession plan visible.
- **Rizzo Brothers** — 50-99 employees, $5-20M. Upper edge of target range. 72-year 3rd-generation. Commercial/industrial. SAM.gov registered. Bilingual workforce. May already have formal systems at this scale. Revisit if needed.
- **Turner Painting (Monroe OH)** — Too small (1-4 employees). Already uses Jobber FSM software — too tech-forward.
- **PPD Painting** — Not local HQ. Founded in Chicago, Cincinnati is expansion location. Multi-city corporate operation.
- **The Ohio Painting Company** — Not Cincinnati-based. HQ in Dayton, serves Cincinnati as expansion market.
- **Ohio Signature Painting** — Too small. Two UC grads + handful of painters.

**Restoration:**
- **Independent Restoration Services (IRS-513)** — National chain. Expanded to 27+ U.S. cities with 32+ locations as of January 2026. Despite "independent" branding, centrally managed.
- **Clarke Contractors** — Acquired by Roebling Capital Partners (PE) in March 2025. Now receiving "technology, marketing, and operational infrastructure" investment.
- **SERVPRO, ServiceMaster Restore, Paul Davis, DRYmedic, PuroClean, Rainbow International, 1-800-Water Damage** — National franchises. Explicitly excluded.
- **RestorAid** — Unclear employee count (sources range 2-49). Controller Brooke Desserich also CEO of The Cure Starts Now Foundation (divided attention). Not 24/7. Weak pain signals. Deferred.
- **Shamrock Restoration** — Primarily roofing/siding contractor. Restoration is secondary service.

**Cleaning:**
- **JANCOA Janitorial Services** — Too large. ~550 employees. Known nationally for employee retention programs.
- **NSG (National Service Group)** — Too large. ~$110M revenue, 200-500 employees.
- **Anago, Jan-Pro, Coverall, Stratus, Vanguard, The Cleaning Authority, MaidThis, Buildingstars** — National franchises. Excluded.
- **Precision Cleaning Systems (PCS Janitorial)** — Already in CSV (row 125). Not duplicated.

**Pest Control:**
- **ScherZinger Pest Control** — Already in CSV (row 112). Too large at 50+ employees, $20-50M. Actively acquiring companies.
- **Tri-Stec Exterminating** — Too small. Described as "one man operation" on Nextdoor. 42 years in business but sole proprietor.
- **Affordable Pest Control** — Insufficient data. 45 years in business but can't confirm 5+ employees.
- **A.G. Pest Control** — Too small. Likely 1-3 people.

# BLUE COLLAR SERVICES — BATCH 3 EXPANSION (Handyman, Locksmith, Glass, Misc)

## Priority 1

### A.B. Bonded Locksmiths
- **Website:** https://www.ablocks.com/
- **Size:** 10-19 employees, ~$1.5-3M revenue, locksmith + alarm + access control
- **Founded:** 1933 (93 years, 4th generation)
- **Key People:** Russ McGurrin (President/Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** Template website. No FSM or CRM. No online booking. Phone-only. FMCSA fleet registration (DOT #3551058).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Customer no-show on 11am appointment — locksmith never arrived.
  - Phone quote was half the on-site price — pricing inconsistency.
  - Customer reported scratched window/door, owner refused to fix.
  - FMCSA-registered fleet serving massive tri-state area (OH/KY/IN) with 10-19 people across 7 service lines.
  - 24/7 dispatch commitment with zero visible scheduling technology.
- **Why:** A 93-year, 4th-generation family locksmith with a registered fleet, 7 service lines (locksmith, alarm, access control, CCTV, safes, automotive, emergency), and 24/7 dispatch — all running on phone calls with no FSM. The pricing inconsistency between phone quotes and on-site charges screams lack of standardized estimating. Russ McGurrin appears to be the single decision-maker with no visible ops staff. The FMCSA fleet registration confirms they run service vehicles but have no fleet management technology.

### Mr. Lock Locksmiths / Mr. Lock Security
- **Website:** http://www.mrlocksecurity.com/ (HTTP, not HTTPS)
- **Size:** 20+ employees, ~$2-4M revenue, locksmith + alarm + camera + access control
- **Founded:** ~1980s (David "Mr. Lock" Sohngen era)
- **Key People:** Kim Sohngen (VP/Owner — widow of founder)
- **Tech Stack:** HTTP website (!). PHP. Fax number listed. No email address anywhere. 4 phone numbers across 2 area codes. No FSM, CRM, or online booking.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Founder David "Mr. Lock" Sohngen died September 2017 (Parkinson's disease, age 60).** Kim Sohngen (widow) has been running the business since.
  - No email address published anywhere — phone and fax only for a 20+ person operation.
  - HTTP website (no SSL security).
  - No weekend service despite having a fleet — capacity underutilization.
  - BBB lists "new ownership" effective 8/1/2023 — recent formal transition.
  - 4.9/5 review average. Cincinnati Magazine Best Locksmith.
- **Why:** The most sensitive and potentially highest-value prospect in this batch. A 20+ person locksmith fleet where the founder died of Parkinson's in 2017 and his widow Kim took over. She's running a security company with no email, no website security (HTTP), a fax machine, and 4 phone numbers. The formal ownership transition was only registered with BBB in 2023 — 6 years after David's death. This signals a gradual, likely reluctant takeover. Kim is a textbook Backbone who was thrust into the Reluctant Operator role. Outreach requires extreme sensitivity. Anderson Chamber member.

### Klinge Lock and Safe
- **Website:** https://www.klingelock.com/
- **Size:** 5-15 employees, $5.7M revenue, locksmith + safe + access control
- **Founded:** 1872 (154 years)
- **Key People:** Lew Schmitt Jr. (Co-Owner); Becky Withers (Co-Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** Yahoo email (klingelock@yahoo.com). Template website (Wix-style). No FSM or CRM. No online booking.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Yahoo email for a $5.7M business.** The single strongest tech-lag signal.
  - 154 years old — all institutional knowledge in two co-owners' heads.
  - Advertise 24/7 service but hours listed as M-F 8:30-5 — disconnect.
  - Revenue ($5.7M) to employee count (5-15) mismatch is extreme — either heavy subcontracting or very lean.
  - BBB A+ with 0 complaints — service quality is solid, back-office is the gap.
  - Veteran and senior discounts offered.
- **Why:** A 154-year-old locksmith business running on Yahoo email. Lew Schmitt Jr. and Becky Withers are the only two named people in the entire organization across all public sources. Two people managing a $5.7M operation is the definition of single-point-of-failure risk. The 24/7 promise vs. M-F hours disconnect suggests they either can't staff nights/weekends or gave up trying. The Yahoo email is the conversation opener.

### ProMaster Home Repair & Handyman
- **Website:** https://www.mastermylist.com/
- **Size:** 15-20 employees, ~$3.8M revenue, handyman + remodeling
- **Founded:** 2006 (20 years)
- **Key People:** Don Kennedy (Owner/President, Air Force veteran, SDVOSB)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress (WP Rocket, Yoast, MySQL). Google Tag Manager. Online scheduling page exists. No visible FSM (ServiceTitan/Housecall Pro/Jobber not detected).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Angi: **"Framing very poor, drywall had to redo twice."** Quality inconsistency at scale.
  - Glassdoor: **"I don't get micro-managed"** — translates to: crews operate autonomously with no field oversight.
  - $79 estimate charge creates customer friction.
  - Active hiring at $35/hr with career ladder (helper → craftsman → lead → manager) — scaling but without operational controls.
- **Why:** The largest and most established handyman prospect. $3.8M revenue with 15-20 employees and a career ladder suggests a company trying to professionalize, but the quality complaints and "no micro-management" Glassdoor review reveal crews operating without oversight systems. Don Kennedy is an Air Force veteran running an SDVOSB — disciplined background, likely receptive to structured operations. Batavia/Milford OH.

### Handy Home Guys LLC
- **Website:** https://www.handyhomeguys.com
- **Size:** 11-50 employees (ZoomInfo), ~$1-3M estimated revenue, handyman + remodeling + landscaping
- **Founded:** December 24, 2012 (12 years)
- **Key People:** Cebastian Hilton (CEO/Co-Owner); Justin Fay (Co-Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. Facebook Pixel. No FSM or CRM. No online booking. No customer portal.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Angi: **"Trouble with follow up."** Customer explicitly identifies the operational gap.
  - Not BBB accredited after 12 years.
  - Broad service mix (plumbing, landscaping, construction, handyman) = massive scheduling complexity.
  - W-2 employment model (not 1099 subs) = higher management overhead.
  - Nextdoor Neighborhood Favorite 2022-2023 — demand is strong, ops are the bottleneck.
- **Why:** The "trouble with follow up" quote is the most direct customer statement of operational pain. A company with strong demand (Nextdoor Favorite) and a broad service mix but no scheduling technology. The CEO title (unusual for a handyman company) signals professionalization aspirations that outpace current systems. Terrace Park/Cincinnati OH.

### Affordable Home Repair Co.
- **Website:** https://www.affordablehomerepairco.com/
- **Size:** 3-10 employees, handyman + remodeling
- **Founded:** ~1990 (35+ years)
- **Key People:** Jack Edwards (Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic template site (Wix-style). No FSM. No online booking. No social media. Zero tech adoption.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Owner forgot appointments and screens calls.** The most visceral operational breakdown documented.
  - No-show pattern documented across reviews.
  - No receipts provided to customers.
  - Angi 3.0/5 — lowest in the Cincinnati handyman market.
  - Quality praised when work actually happens — operations are the failure point, not craftsmanship.
- **Why:** The pain signal here is almost too raw — an owner literally forgetting appointments and screening calls. This is what happens when a 35-year business runs on one person's memory with zero systems. The quality of work is good when it gets done, which makes the operational failures even more frustrating for customers. BBB accredited since 2016. Cincinnati OH.

### Ryan's All-Glass
- **Website:** https://ryansallglass.com/
- **Size:** ~26-40 employees, ~$13M revenue, auto + residential + commercial glass, 5 locations (1 recently closed)
- **Founded:** 1982 (44 years)
- **Key People:** Bruce Ryan (President/Founder); Dan Ryan (Owner/Commercial VP, 2nd generation); Jeff Grupenhof (GM); George Lantz (VP/Estimator/PM); Herb South (PM)
- **Tech Stack:** No FSM, CRM, or dispatch software. No customer portal. Phone/form only. Procore network listing (directory, not user).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Customer reported glass **"re-cut SIX times."**
  - Shower door took **"well over 3 months"** instead of quoted 6 weeks.
  - **"They never called with updates."**
  - Arrival 1 hour before quoted window. 3-week wait for a measurement visit.
  - Recently closed Beechmont Ave location — possible contraction.
  - 3-division scheduling (auto/residential/commercial) = extreme coordination complexity.
- **Why:** The glass-re-cut-six-times story is devastating. A $13M, 40-person, 5-location glass company with no dispatch or CRM. The 3-division model (auto, residential, commercial) creates scheduling complexity that manual coordination can't handle — and the customer complaints prove it. Dan Ryan (2nd gen) taking over from Bruce (founder) is the succession window. Recently closing one location may signal operational strain. Springfield Pike Cincinnati.

### Frank's Glass Inc.
- **Website:** https://franksglass.com/ (also https://cincinnatiglassservice.com/)
- **Size:** ~11 employees (down from 20+), ~$6.1M revenue, auto + residential + commercial glass
- **Founded:** 1970 (56 years)
- **Key People:** Dan Brinkmann (Owner/President, 2nd gen since 1994); Nathan Brinkmann (Commercial Manager, 3rd gen); Sandy Kuznof (Marketing Director)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. Dual URLs (franksglass.com + cincinnatiglassservice.com). No FSM or CRM. Phone/form only. Chamber member.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Technician **"showed up 90 minutes late."**
  - Customer spent **"a month trying to get management to admit to damage."**
  - **"Frank's Glass does not stand behind their work."**
  - Workforce contracted from 20+ to ~11 — business under strain.
  - Not BBB accredited despite 56 years.
  - Glassdoor review praises Dan as a people-first owner who made **"zero layoffs"** during a downturn — textbook Reluctant Operator who cares about employees but lacks systems.
- **Why:** A 56-year, 3-generation glass company that has contracted from 20+ employees to 11. Dan Brinkmann is described on Glassdoor as a people-first owner — the kind who absorbs operational pain personally rather than implementing systems. The dual website situation (two URLs, no consolidation) reflects the fragmented operations. The damage-denial complaint ("a month trying to get management to admit") suggests no incident tracking process. Fairfield OH.

### Chimney Works Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.chimneyworksonline.com/
- **Size:** ~27 employees, ~$500K revenue, chimney sweep + repair + stoves
- **Founded:** 2001 (25 years)
- **Key People:** Steve May (President/Founder); Jake Sena (General Manager)
- **Tech Stack:** GoDaddy Website Builder. Gmail (chimneyworks@gmail.com). Zero operational software — no CRM, scheduling, or payment integrations.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: Wrong-size liner installed, **"liner was too small and the fireplace became unusable."**
  - BBB: Owner retained $500 of $900 deposit for **"his time"** despite zero work performed.
  - Customer: Company **"lied about the performance of the wood stove"** — product misrepresentation.
  - Gmail email for a 27-employee company.
  - GoDaddy website builder — most basic possible web presence.
  - 4.7/5 Google with ~800 reviews — strong demand, but operational complaints reveal quality gaps.
- **Why:** A 27-employee chimney company running on Gmail and a GoDaddy website builder with zero operational software. The sizing error (wrong liner making a fireplace unusable) is a job-management and measurement-workflow failure. The deposit dispute ($500 retained for "time" with no work done) suggests no formal contract or invoicing system. 800 Google reviews prove demand is there — it's operations that are lagging. Civic Center Dr Cincinnati. BBB A+ since 2002.

## Priority 2

### Eagle's Locksmith Cincinnati
- **Website:** https://eagleslocksmith.com/
- **Size:** 3-8 employees, locksmith 24/7 emergency
- **Founded:** ~2006-2015 (inconsistent dates across sources)
- **Key People:** Igal Karito (President/Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress/custom site with strong SEO. No FSM or CRM. No email published. Contact form only.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB complaint: described as **"dishonest"** on a commercial job.
  - 25-minute response promise with a tiny team — aggressive SLA for the headcount.
  - Owner is primary technician + manager + marketer — total single point of failure.
  - Founded date inconsistent across sources (2006/2012/2015) — possibly reflects business pivots.
- **Why:** Small but with acute owner-bottleneck pain. Igal Karito does everything — keys, estimates, SEO, customer service. The 25-minute response promise with fewer than 8 people is operationally unsustainable without dispatch software. Downtown Cincinnati (414 Walnut St). Phone-only outreach recommended.

### Fritts Painting & Carpentry
*(See Batch 2 — already documented)*

### All Around Joe LLC
- **Website:** https://myallaroundjoe.net/
- **Size:** 5-15 employees, ~$500K-2M estimated, handyman + remodeling
- **Founded:** February 9, 1996 (30 years)
- **Key People:** Lawrence Joseph "Joe" Wood (Owner/Operator); Rita (office coordinator)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress-based. No FSM. No online booking. No customer portal. Phone and web form only.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 30-year business with zero systemization.
  - Rita (office coordinator) doing damage-control fire drills.
  - No middle management between Joe and the field crew (Dave, Moe, Mike, John, Brandon).
  - No succession plan visible.
  - Award-winning reputation (BBB Torch Award, Angi Super Service 5+ years) but operationally plateaued.
- **Why:** A 30-year handyman business with a BBB Torch Award that has never implemented operational systems. Joe Wood runs everything through Rita (office coordinator) who handles scheduling, customer calls, and fire drills. The field crew operates without middle management. Milford OH.

### CheckMark Pros
- **Website:** https://checkmarkpros.com/
- **Size:** 3-10+ employees, handyman + cleaning + remodeling (multi-division)
- **Founded:** ~2018
- **Key People:** K.C. Cochran (Founder/Owner, former corporate COO)
- **Tech Stack:** Markate (basic FSM). Professional website. Not WordPress.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Owner manages business **remotely while traveling for ministry** — not day-to-day.
  - Multi-division operation (handyman + cleaning + remodel) with tiny team.
  - PPP loan $5,693 (2020) — very small, suggesting limited revenue at the time.
  - Career tiers (Helper → Pro → Lead Pro → Manager) — aspirational structure, possibly outpacing actual scale.
  - Using Markate (entry-level FSM) — may be outgrowing it.
- **Why:** Interesting because K.C. Cochran is a former corporate COO who understands operations but is running the business remotely while traveling. He's already invested in Markate (basic FSM) and built career tiers — this is someone who thinks about systems but may have outgrown his current tools. Hebron KY.

### The Fence Company LLC
- **Website:** https://thefencecompanyonline.com/
- **Size:** ~5-10 employees, fence installation + repair
- **Founded:** 1997 (29 years)
- **Key People:** Gina M. Donisi (Owner, "Fence Lady"); Joe Miller (Management)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress/Avada. MySalesman CRM (quoting/lead qualification). Google Analytics. No field dispatch visible.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Crew broke a pipe during installation.
  - **"Final section of fence was rushed with misaligned slats and breaks, posts shifted so gates won't close."**
  - **"Only about 1/3 of needed holes were dug, and crew said they needed equipment they didn't have."**
  - **"Privacy slats were never mentioned despite customer inquiry, and installation crews didn't know about the lock strip."**
- **Why:** The crew communication breakdowns are the story here — crews show up without the right equipment, don't know about customer-requested features, and rush finish work. Gina Donisi has invested in MySalesman CRM for lead qualification but doesn't have field dispatch tools. The gap between quoting (systematized) and execution (chaotic) is the opportunity. fencelady@fuse.net email. Loveland OH. BBB A+ since 2011.

### Allied Glass & Mirror Co.
- **Website:** https://alliedglassandmirror.com/
- **Size:** ~6-12 employees, ~$1M revenue, architectural + custom glass
- **Founded:** 1947 (79 years)
- **Key People:** Marty Mandel (Owner, nephew of founder Norman Horwitz); Linda Mandel (VP); Zac Hiudt (Operations Manager, next-gen); Jimmy Farmer (Lead Glazier, 25+ years); Tyler Farmer (Apprentice, Jimmy's son)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress with blog. No online scheduling, customer portal, or CRM/FSM/dispatch. Phone-first culture.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor confirms glaziers work **"out independently on installs most days"** — no centralized dispatch.
  - Lead glazier Jimmy Farmer (25 years) is training his son Tyler as replacement — institutional knowledge concentrated and being transferred person-to-person rather than into systems.
  - Generational transition from Marty Mandel to Zac Hiudt (Ops Manager, next-gen leadership).
  - No public email address. Benefits described informally suggesting manual HR management.
- **Why:** A 79-year glass company in active generational transition with glaziers working independently and zero dispatch technology. Zac Hiudt as the new Ops Manager may be the modernization champion. Reading Rd Cincinnati. BBB A+ since 1999.

### VesCo Residential Cleaning
*(See Batch 2 — already documented)*

## Priority 3

### Family Handyman & Remodeling Services LLC
- **Website:** https://fhmrservices.com/
- **Size:** 3-10 employees, handyman + remodeling
- **Founded:** Unknown
- **Key People:** Owner unknown — requires phone recon to identify
- **Tech Stack:** Professional template site. No FSM, online booking, or customer portal.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - No BBB presence whatsoever.
  - Broad service offering from very small team.
  - Marketing (professional website, Yelp photos) outpaces operational infrastructure.
  - West Chester OH — growth market.
- **Why:** Watch-list only. Cannot pursue without identifying the owner. Must call to qualify. 8630 Brookridge Dr West Chester OH.

### Disqualified (This Batch)

**Handyman:**
- **Mr. Handyman of Greater Cincinnati, Mr. Handyman of NKY, Ace Handyman Services, TruBlue Total Home Care** — National franchises.
- **Handyman Connection** — HQ in Cincinnati but national franchise system (200+ territories). Excluded despite local HQ.
- **Cincinnati Handyman Services LLC, Dan's Handyman Service, Mr. & Mrs. Handyman Service, 1GOOD Handyman Service** — Too small or too new.
- **Uncle Handy** — Broker model (connects customers to contractors), not a service provider.

**Locksmith:**
- **Acme Lock & Door** — Acquired by Cobalt Service Partners (PE firm) in May 2025. No longer independent.
- **Pop-A-Lock of Cincinnati** — National franchise (550+ locations).
- **FlyLock Security Solutions** — National franchise (92+ locations).
- **Golden Key Locksmith, Allied Lock & Door, Mr. B's Locks & Keys** — Too small (estimated 2-5 employees each).

**Glass:**
- **Safelite AutoGlass, Glass Doctor** — National chains. Excluded.
- **Glenny Glass (Milford OH)** — Too large. 95+ employees, 107,000 sq ft facility. Well above target range.
- **Hilltop Glass & Mirror** — Borderline small (~5 employees, $608K revenue). Strongest pain signals of the glass group relative to size (poor communication, scheduling conflicts from owner running dual businesses) but budget may limit software investment.
- **Inst-I-Glass** — Multi-state operation (9 locations across IL/KY/MI/MO/OH/TN). Not truly local independent.

**Misc:**
- **Cincinnati Door & Opener** — Already uses HouseCall Pro (FSM). 4 locations, BBB A+, zero complaints. Too tech-forward and too clean for Ops for Shops pitch.
- **Overhead Door Co. of Greater Cincinnati, Precision Garage Door, OGD Overhead Garage Door** — National chains/franchises.
- **Mills Fence Company** — Too large.
- **Superior Fence & Rail** — National franchise.
- **Mr. Appliance of Cincinnati, Sears Home Services** — National franchises.
- **Perfect Power Wash** — Too large.
- **Sparkle Wash Cincinnati, Squeegee Squad Cincinnati** — National franchises.
- **iShine Cincy** — Already in CSV (row 132). Not duplicated.

# CONSTRUCTION/TRADES — BATCH 4 EXPANSION (GCs, Concrete, Masonry, Excavation)

**Added 2026-02-12 | +15 new prospects | Running total: 186/500**

This batch deepens the Construction/Trades vertical with four sub-segments not previously covered: general contractors, concrete, masonry, and excavation. The existing 15 Construction/Trades entries (rows 75-89) focus on remodelers, HVAC/plumbing, and roofing. These new entries fill the gaps.

## General Contractors

### Priority 1

### BHI General Contracting
- **Website:** https://bhi-gc.com/
- **Size:** ~13-20 employees, $5-15M revenue
- **Founded:** ~2002 (incorporated 2008)
- **Key People:** Jim Mitchell (CEO/Co-Founder); Brad Mitchell (Co-Founder/Superintendent — Jim's brother); Jake Jacobs (CFO/Co-Founder — former bank IT exec who designed and runs the ENTIRE back office); Jim Davis (Senior Site Superintendent)
- **Email:** jim.mitchell@bhi-gc.com (INFERRED — first.last pattern at 40% per RocketReach)
- **Tech Stack:** Jake Jacobs single-handedly designed, developed, and runs the back office — a catastrophic single point of failure. No Procore, Buildertrend, or named construction management software anywhere.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor (50 reviews — extraordinary for a 13-20 person company, signals active venting):
  - **"The pay was decent but being forced buying a new truck day one immediately ruined my outlook for this company."**
  - **"$1000 a month for health insurance (for one person!) making $17/hour while trying to take care of their family is not sustainable."**
  - **"Lied to numerous times about promotions while watching others get special treatment for being related or buddies of someone in management."**
  - **"You will work twice as hard and twice as long to accomplish and achieve for BHI just to be passed over for a management role for someone's son."**
  - **"Communication struggles between departments."**
- **Why:** Highest-signal GC prospect. 50 Glassdoor reviews from a 13-20 person company = employees are screaming online. Nepotism complaints center on the Mitchell family dynamic (two brothers co-own). Compensation policies are incoherent ($80K truck purchase required with a vehicle allowance that doesn't cover it). The entire back office depends on ONE co-founder (Jake Jacobs). **Critical note: BHI is the sister company to Remark Construction (row 79).** Jake Jacobs runs back office for BOTH companies. This connection could be leveraged — or it could mean Jake already fills the ops consultant role.

### Perry Contracting Inc.
- **Website:** https://perrycontractinginc.com/
- **Size:** ~16 employees, ~$5M revenue
- **Founded:** November 1989 (37 years)
- **Key People:** Jim Perry (CEO/Founder — 5 decades in construction); Luke Perry (VP — Jim's son, ABC 2022 National Young Professional of the Year); Terry Meyer (Office Manager/Accountant — 35 years); Nate Sturm (Project Manager)
- **Email:** lperry@perrycontractinginc.com (INFERRED); pci@perrycontractinginc.com (CONFIRMED from website)
- **Tech Stack:** Recently adopted unnamed PM software (implementation pain likely). WordPress site. No dedicated IT support.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Jim Perry personally **"evaluates business opportunities, meets with clients to tailor construction solutions, and guides project managers through unique challenges."** Aging founder still the hub for every decision.
  - Terry Meyer **"manages all accounting and payroll processing"** — one person, 35 years, zero documentation, zero redundancy.
  - Recently **"rolled out a whole new project management software to focus on technology"** — explicit admission they were behind on tech.
  - Goering Center member (UC's family business transition center) — actively navigating father-to-son succession.
  - BuildZoom top 2% of 52,717 Ohio contractors. 1,600+ completed projects.
- **Why:** Textbook "family GC in transition." Aging founder handing to award-winning son, one-person back office holding 35 years of undocumented institutional knowledge, new PM software rollout without IT support. Goering Center membership means they're already spending money on business advisory — receptive to consulting.

### Huber General Contracting
- **Website:** https://hubergc.com/
- **Size:** ~15-25 employees, $5-15M revenue
- **Founded:** 1991 (34 years)
- **Key People:** Sam Schaffner (President/Owner — came up as PM→Ops Mgr→GM→President); Wayne Huber (Founder, likely semi-retired); Justin Verbeck (Operations Manager)
- **Email:** inquire@hubergc.com (CONFIRMED from website); sschaffner@hubergc.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** No construction management software visible. Fax (513-674-1759) still prominently listed. Generic "inquire@" inbox. No client portal.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Sam Schaffner **"started with Huber in 2007 as a Project Manager, and over the next 10 years gained valuable knowledge and experience"** — all operational knowledge transferred person-to-person, not through documented systems.
  - Zero Glassdoor reviews. Zero Indeed reviews. For a 34-year company with 15-25 employees, this near-total absence signals no formal HR or employee engagement.
  - Not BBB accredited despite 34 years in business.
  - Fax number still prominent on website.
- **Why:** Recently completed ownership succession. New owner (Sam) came up through operations and should understand the value proposition. The fax, zero online footprint, generic email, and absence of any tech stack all point to a company running on handshakes and institutional memory. Food/beverage, brewery, chemical manufacturer, and industrial clients = complex commercial work.

### Priority 2

### JDL Warm Construction LLC
- **Website:** https://jdlwarm.com/
- **Size:** ~8 employees, ~$9.1M revenue
- **Founded:** 1903 (original Warm Construction); current entity 2008
- **Key People:** Jacob W. Warm (CEO/Co-Owner — great-grandson of founder); Gayle Warm (Co-Owner); Sydney Warm (Co-Owner); Greg Dickman (CFO)
- **Email:** jwarm@jdlwarm.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** No construction management software. No client portal. No blog. Basic website. The entire org is 3 family co-owners + 1 CFO.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **8 employees generating $9.1M** = $1.1M revenue per head. Dangerously lean — zero slack capacity.
  - Indeed: **"not enough jobs that pay well or that have benefits."**
  - Indeed: **"flexibility of time and the owner becoming a friend"** — personal relationships substitute for formal processes.
  - 4th-generation family business culture = deeply ingrained "the way we've always done it."
- **Why:** 120+ year legacy. Built Cincinnati landmarks (Dixie Terminal, Belvedere Apartments, Seagram distilleries). The revenue-per-employee ratio is extraordinary and fragile — if one person leaves, they lose ~12% capacity overnight. Process documentation could capture institutional knowledge that currently lives in only 8 heads.

### Cincinnati Commercial Contracting (CCC)
- **Website:** https://cccontracting.com/
- **Size:** ~21 employees, ~$8.4M revenue
- **Founded:** 1979 (47 years)
- **Key People:** John Westheimer (Founder/President); Amy Westheimer (Director of Sales); Jason Manni (VP — succession designee); Justin Platt (VP — succession designee); Faith Taylor (Marketing Manager); Heath Preston (Director of Business Development)
- **Email:** jmanni@cccontracting.com (INFERRED); jwestheimer@cincigroup.com (INFERRED — note different domain)
- **Tech Stack:** Founder email on cincigroup.com, company on cccontracting.com — fragmented. Fax (513-561-3554) active. Website states **"dedicated to staying at the forefront... embracing emerging technologies"** but zero evidence of any implementation.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 47-year founder dependency. John Westheimer personally IS the brand — AIA profile titled "Cincinnati Commercial Contracting - Westheimer."
  - Succession announced to Jason Manni and Justin Platt but founder still on a different email domain.
  - Not BBB accredited despite 47 years.
  - Also operates Westheimer Real Estate (WRE) as a sister division — dual-entity complexity.
- **Why:** The aspiration-execution gap is the opening: they SAY they embrace technology but show zero evidence. VPs Jason Manni and Justin Platt are the real targets — they're the ones who will need operational systems to run CCC without the founder.

---

## Concrete

### Priority 1

### Gentrup Concrete LLC
- **Website:** https://www.gentrupconcrete.com/ (also nkyconcreterepair.com)
- **Size:** 10-19 employees, $1-5M revenue
- **Founded:** 1919 (4th generation, 107 years)
- **Key People:** Chris Gentrup (Owner/President)
- **Email:** None published. Try chris@gentrupconcrete.com or info@gentrupconcrete.com.
- **Tech Stack:** Two separate Wix-style DIY websites for the same business. No CRM, scheduling, or estimating tools. Square/Venmo for payments. No published email.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Owner personally writes every bid and schedules every appointment. 60-90 day backlog.
  - Cannot take phone calls during busy season.
  - Porch: **"Very poor workmanship. Failed to install gravel and rebar."**
  - **"Does not complete jobs. Would not return calls or answer calls."**
- **Why:** 4th-gen family concrete company where the owner IS the bottleneck. 60-90 day backlog with an owner who can't answer the phone = leaving money on the table every day. Two separate websites for the same company signals fragmented operations. Bellevue, KY.

### Cohorn Concrete Construction LLC
- **Website:** https://www.cohornconcrete.com/
- **Size:** 15-20 employees, ~$1.1M revenue
- **Founded:** 1994/1995 (31 years)
- **Key People:** Christopher Cohorn (President/Owner)
- **Email:** NONE published anywhere for a 31-year-old company.
- **Tech Stack:** Squarespace-style template. Active fax (859-359-0554). 4 different phone numbers across directories with no unified system. No CRM. No scheduling. No dispatch. No fleet management. DOT-registered commercial vehicles (USDOT #2195678).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - No published email anywhere in 2026.
  - Active fax line.
  - 4 different phone numbers and 2 different addresses across directories — total inconsistency.
  - DOT-registered fleet without fleet management software.
  - Website markets "clear communication" — likely a known pain point they're trying to address through marketing rather than operations.
- **Why:** A 31-year concrete/excavation/demolition company that has no email address, still uses fax, has inconsistent contact information across every directory, and runs DOT-registered vehicles without fleet software. The fact that they explicitly market "clear communication" suggests they know it's a problem. Walton, KY. BBB A+ since 2008.

### Patterned Concrete of Cincinnati Inc.
- **Website:** https://patternedconcrete.us/
- **Size:** 10-25 employees, <$5M revenue
- **Founded:** 1994 (32 years)
- **Key People:** Sandra Schneider (President); Paul Schneider (VP/Owner — designer, installer, estimator, ASCC board member); Kris Schneider (Operations Manager)
- **Email:** None published. Try paul@patternedconcrete.us or info@patternedconcrete.us.
- **Tech Stack:** Basic HTML/template site. Active fax (513-870-9122). No CRM. No scheduling. No PM software. Blue Book listed (subcontractor for GCs) without bid management system.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Paul wears every hat: VP + designer + installer + estimator + ASCC national board member.
  - All-family management (Sandra, Paul, Kris — all Schneiders).
  - Zero Indeed/Glassdoor reviews = no HR function whatsoever.
  - No job postings anywhere = no recruiting process.
  - Blue Book subcontractor doing marquee commercial work (Cincinnati Zoo, Ark Encounter, Christ Hospital) without project management software.
  - Business grew from Paul's hobby without operational planning.
- **Why:** Specialized decorative/stamped concrete company doing prestigious commercial work with zero operational infrastructure. Paul Schneider is the definition of a skilled tradesman who grew a hobby into a business without ever building the business systems. The Ark Encounter and Cincinnati Zoo are impressive projects managed with no visible PM software. Fairfield, OH.

### Priority 2

### Cost Effective Concrete (CHCEC Construction LLC)
- **Website:** https://costeffectiveconcrete.com/
- **Size:** 5-15 employees, <$5M revenue
- **Founded:** 2017/2018
- **Key People:** Calvin Hall (Owner/CEO — 3rd generation)
- **Email:** calvin@costeffectiveconcrete.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. Microsoft 365. Google AdSense. No CRM, scheduling, or PM tools. Home-based operation.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: **"installed asphalt driveway without installing crushed gravel base despite it being included in the contract."**
  - **"Gave the company multiple chances over 4-5 months...promises to fix that never happen."**
  - Consumer Choice Award winner operating from residential address with informal "associates."
- **Why:** Consumer Choice Award for Best Concrete Contractor but BBB complaints suggest follow-through problems. The award + complaints pattern = a company that wins work but can't manage execution consistently. Home-based with informal "associates" rather than employees. Mt. Washington, Cincinnati.

---

## Masonry

### Priority 1

### Cincinnati Chimney & Masonry Inc.
- **Website:** https://cincinnatichimney.com/
- **Size:** ~5-15 employees, $1-3M revenue
- **Founded:** ~1994 (30+ years)
- **Key People:** Brian Byrd (Owner/President — handles ALL calls and emails personally)
- **Email:** brian@cincinnatichimney.com (CONFIRMED)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic template site. No online booking. No CRM. Customer told they're **"on the board"** = physical whiteboard scheduling. Owner is sole contact point.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **OWNER'S OWN ADMISSION** in BBB response: **"I would like to apologize for the lack of communication from myself and office."** Acknowledged **"It is not normal for us to be delayed this long to start a repair."**
  - Customer paid $1,800, told 2 weeks, waited 2+ months: **"I've called twice and they just tell me I'm 'on the board.'"**
  - $99 inspection lasted 5 minutes — customer felt **"like they came to my house and stole $99."**
- **Why:** The strongest masonry prospect because the OWNER HAS PUBLICLY ADMITTED the operational failure. Brian Byrd apologized for scheduling and communication breakdowns in writing on the BBB. He knows the problem exists. He handles every call personally with no office manager — classic one-man bottleneck. The "on the board" whiteboard scheduling is exactly what Ops for Shops replaces. Cheviot/West Side Cincinnati.

### Priority 2

### Precision Masonry Contracting LLC
- **Website:** https://precisionmasonrycontracting.com/
- **Size:** ~5-15 employees, $500K-$2M revenue
- **Founded:** January 2021
- **Key People:** Nick Hunsche (Owner/Founder)
- **Email:** hunschenicholas09@gmail.com (CONFIRMED — personal Gmail as business email)
- **Tech Stack:** Professional website but Gmail for business (!). No CRM. No PM software. No scheduling. No contract management. Contractor license expired (BuildZoom flagged 02-05-2025).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: **"Nick takes deposits and never comes through. Left a mess and did subpar work."**
  - Chamber of Commerce 3.0/5 stars: **"Horribly unprofessional."** **"DON'T USE THIS COMPANY."**
  - BUT also: **"Best masonry company in Cincinnati... provides great service with excellent results."** and **"Wow, what a beautiful front stoop."**
  - The sharp split between "excellent work" and "never comes through" = skilled tradesman overwhelmed by the business side.
- **Why:** Young company growing faster than its systems. Professional website masks zero back-office infrastructure. Gmail as business email. Expired contractor license signals administrative chaos. The positive reviews prove the craft is good — the business operations are failing him. Harrison, OH.

## Excavation

### Priority 1

### Garrett Excavating LLC
- **Website:** https://garrettex.com/
- **Size:** ~20-50 employees, $5-12M revenue
- **Founded:** 2018
- **Key People:** Andy Garrett (President/Owner); "Derby" (Superintendent/Field Lead)
- **Email:** info@garrettex.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** GPS-guided heavy equipment in the field (advanced), but NO office/operations software. No PM. No scheduling. No dispatch. No fleet management despite DOT fleet. Single generic inbox.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed Equipment Operator (2.5/5), Dump Truck Driver (1.5/5), Superintendent (2.0/5):
  - **"A typical day felt disorganized and exhausting."**
  - **"There is no communication from the higher ups to the guys actually doing the work."**
  - **"Absolutely no communication with supervisors at all."**
  - **"Equipment is worn down and it's hard to get the mechanics to fix anything."**
  - **"Drivers almost killed themselves because of brake failure due to not servicing the brakes."**
  - **"Continuously employs outside managers who have not the slightest idea what is actually making the company money."**
- **Why:** Grew too fast for its systems. GPS-guided equipment in the field but zero communication, scheduling, or dispatch software in the office. The Indeed reviews are devastating — employees describe daily chaos, dangerous equipment, and management that has no field credibility. Not BBB accredited. Blue Ash, OH.

### Diggit Excavating Inc.
- **Website:** https://diggit-inc.com/
- **Size:** ~12 employees, ~$6.6M revenue
- **Founded:** 1986 (acquired by current owner in 2020)
- **Key People:** Wade Brown (President/Owner — UC Civil Engineering 2015, worked at Diggit since high school, purchased from founders Tom and Amy)
- **Email:** wade@diggit-inc.com (CONFIRMED); support@diggit-inc.com (CONFIRMED)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress/Squarespace. Eploy ATS (has a recruiting tool but no ops software). goo.gl links (dated). Owner knows AutoCAD (manual estimating). No PM. No scheduling. No dispatch.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"The guys in the office make it almost impossible to get jobs done on time."**
  - **"Communication from management to workers is horrible most times."**
  - **"When you have to work Saturday they don't let you know till Friday evening."** — a specific, measurable scheduling failure.
  - Positive reviews: **"owner/management care about employees"** and **"organizes family functions every season."** Caring but disorganized.
- **Why:** Most textbook ops consultancy prospect. New owner (2020) inherited 1986 company with legacy processes. Wade Brown has the education and ambition (Civil Engineering degree, AutoCAD) but the office-to-field coordination is broken. The Saturday-work-Friday-notification complaint is a concrete, solvable scheduling system failure. BBB accredited since 2012. Lebanon, OH.

### JP Excavating (A&A Demo & Excavating Inc.)
- **Website:** https://jpcincy.com/
- **Size:** ~11-50 employees, $3-8M revenue
- **Founded:** ~2000 (20+ years)
- **Key People:** Andrew Bucher (President); Vicki Higgins (Accounts Manager)
- **Email:** andrew.bucher@jpcincy.com (INFERRED — first.last pattern confirmed)
- **Tech Stack:** TopCon GPS modeling in the field (advanced). Professional website. But no PM software, no scheduling, no dispatch, no CRM. Multi-location (Cincinnati + Burlington KY + Independence KY) without coordination tools.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Put on job with no or little info."**
  - **"Field manager does not communicate."**
  - **"Great if you are a mind reader."**
  - **"They put on a show of lies and many faces."**
  - Older reviews positive (**"Very well run company"**), recent reviews (2023+) deteriorating = hitting a growth/management wall.
  - BuildZoom 92/100 (top 32% Ohio contractors).
- **Why:** The gap between field technology (TopCon GPS) and office operations (workers with "no info") is the story. They invested in precision hardware but not in communication and project management software. Deteriorating Indeed reviews signal an active crisis. 3 addresses across 2 states = coordination complexity. NKY Chamber member.

### Priority 2

### Rector Excavating Inc.
- **Website:** https://rectorexcavating.com/
- **Size:** 20+ employees, $3-7M revenue
- **Founded:** Incorporated 2000 (Randy started in 1990s)
- **Key People:** Randy Rector (Co-Owner/Founder); Patrick Rector (Co-Owner/Operations — next generation)
- **Email:** NONE published anywhere. Contact form only.
- **Tech Stack:** Basic WordPress template. No email published. No scheduling. No dispatch. No fleet tracking. No CRM. Procore listed as subcontractor (directory, not user). NKY Chamber member.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - No published email address anywhere for a 25+ year company with 20+ employees.
  - 3.5/5 Chamber rating (mediocre for the industry).
  - Website states they strive to **"deliver quality work in a timely manner to hit scheduled goals"** — the explicit statement suggests it has been an issue.
  - Father-son management with 20+ employees = classic owner bottleneck.
  - Zero Indeed/Glassdoor reviews at 20+ employees = low employee engagement.
  - Dual locations (E Bend Rd office + Distribution Dr yard) without coordination tools.
- **Why:** Classic "analog contractor." 25+ years, father-son, 20+ employees, virtually no technology beyond a basic website. Patrick Rector's LinkedIn presence suggests the next generation may be open to modernization. Burlington, KY.

### Disqualified (This Batch)

**General Contractors:**
- **Monarch Construction** — Too large. 100-200 employees, $60-79M revenue.
- **Graybach LLC** — Too large/sophisticated. 18-250 employees, $50M+ revenue.
- **Hudawn Construction** — Too large. 55-70 employees across HuDawn Group. Columbus office = geographic expansion.
- **Cintech Construction** — Too tech-forward. Uses Procore, Bluebeam, Autodesk (CAD & Revit), BuildingConnected. 20-23 employees but enterprise-grade tech stack.
- **Woodbine Construction** — Wrong geography (Louisville, KY — 100 miles from Cincinnati).
- **Anderson & Rodgers Construction** — Wrong geography (Lexington, KY).
- **Cutter Construction** — Wrong category (custom home builder, not GC).
- **ATECK Builders** — Too small and too rural (Warsaw, KY).
- **Gustin Construction** — Wrong category (custom homes, not GC).

**Concrete:**
- **Sam the Concrete Man** — National franchise (90+ locations).
- **Dugan & Meyers** — Acquired by Baker Construction (PE-backed). 160+ employees.
- **SRM Concrete (Smyrna Ready Mix)** — 8,500 employees, national chain.
- **Ernst Concrete** — 500-1,000 employees, $100-500M revenue, ~30 plants.
- **Yoder Laser Concrete** — Wrong geography (Millersburg, OH — 90 miles from Cincinnati).
- **Loveland Excavating & Paving** — $12.4M revenue, formal org chart (CEO, COO, VP), Procore user. Too large/mature.
- **Huff Concrete / Basement Armor** — Owner-operator, 1-3 employees. Too small.

**Masonry:**
- **Lang Masonry & Restoration** — Too large. 125+ employees, Midwest-wide.
- **Hicon Inc.** — Too large/mature. 42-47 employees, $16.7M revenue, 3 divisions, dedicated PM.
- **Jacob Masonry Contractors** — Too large/sophisticated. Uses ZoomInfo and Procore. Founded late 1800s, 2 locations.
- **Accurate Masonry LLC** — Too tech-forward. Uses Procore. Has VP of Operations + HR.
- **Rick Arnold Masonry** — Too small (sole proprietor).
- **Oberer Construction Co.** — Borderline small (2-10 employees). Positive reviews, lower pain signals. Generational transition is compelling but small scale limits engagement value.
- **Gaebel Masonry** — Too small (2-10 employees). Rural base (Somerville, OH — 40 miles from downtown). Master craftsman-led but may not justify consulting engagement.

**Excavation:**
- **Loveland Excavating and Paving** — Too large (~85 employees). Formal C-suite.
- **S&E Construction & Septic** — Too small (1-4 employees).
- **Superior Concrete & Excavation** — Too new (founded Jan 2023).
- **Bartling Enterprises LLC** — Too small (FMCSA shows 1 driver).
- **Henry Excavating** — Specialty mismatch (utility/plumbing, not general excavation).

### Updates to Existing Entries

- **Remark Construction (row 79):** BHI General Contracting research confirms the BHI-Remark connection through Jake Jacobs. BHI has 50 Glassdoor reviews with specific operational pain signals. Consider approaching Jake Jacobs as a "two-for-one" conversation covering both Remark and BHI.

## CONSTRUCTION/TRADES — BATCH 5 EXPANSION: Flooring, Painting, Electrical, Drywall

**Added 2026-02-12 | +15 new prospects | Running total: 201/500**

### Flooring Contractors

#### Priority 1

##### Floors by Valvano
- **Website:** https://www.floorsbyvalvano.com/
- **Size:** 5-9 employees, family-owned
- **Founded:** 3rd generation family business (est. 1960s-70s)
- **Key People:** Valvano family (owner names not publicly listed)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic template website. **@fuse.net ISP email** (Cincinnati Bell/altafiber ISP address from the 2000s). No CRM, no scheduling, no customer portal, no online booking.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - @fuse.net email as primary business contact — this is a Cincinnati-specific ISP email, an extraordinarily strong signal of minimal tech adoption
  - Zero Indeed/Glassdoor presence for a multi-generational business
  - No online scheduling or booking capability
- **Why:** A 3rd-generation Cincinnati flooring family using a local ISP email address tells you everything about their technology posture. The Valvano family has survived on craftsmanship and referrals for decades, but has never modernized operations. The @fuse.net email is one of the strongest tech-lag signals we've found in this entire research project.

##### Mullikin Floors & More
- **Website:** https://www.mullikinfloors.com/
- **Size:** 5-15 employees
- **Key People:** Owner (Mullikin family)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic website. No scheduling software, no CRM, no dispatch, no customer portal. Phone-based scheduling only.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB complaint pattern: **"I can't recall 6 times now"** — customer referring to missed/rescheduled appointments
  - Multiple complaints about no-shows and scheduling failures
  - Pattern of scheduling breakdowns suggests zero dispatch or job management tooling
- **Why:** The BBB complaint pattern is textbook scheduling/dispatch pain. When a customer says "I can't recall 6 times now" about missed appointments, this is a company where the scheduling system is someone's memory and a paper calendar. This is exactly the pain Ops for Shops solves.

##### Floorcraft Inc.
- **Website:** N/A (basic web presence)
- **Size:** <25 employees
- **Founded:** Established company, acquired by new owner in 2021
- **Key People:** New owner (acquired 2021)
- **Tech Stack:** Gmail as business email. No domain email. No CRM, no scheduling, no estimating tools.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - New ownership acquisition in 2021 — classic mid-migration transition moment
  - Gmail business email for an established flooring company
  - No Indeed/Glassdoor reviews
- **Why:** Ownership transitions are the #1 window for operations consulting. A new owner who inherited a business with Gmail as the email system and no operational tooling is actively looking for ways to put their stamp on the business. This is a "Mid-Migration Marketer" persona in the making.

#### Priority 2

##### Cincy Preferred Flooring
- **Website:** https://www.cincypreferredflooring.com/
- **Size:** 5-12 employees
- **Founded:** ~2021-2022 (Year 4)
- **Key People:** Owner (name not publicly listed)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic website. No scheduling, no CRM, no customer portal. Phone-only contact.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Year-4 startup scaling beyond founder capacity
  - Growing reputation via word-of-mouth but no systems to support scaling
  - No Indeed/Glassdoor presence
- **Why:** Year-4 startups are in the danger zone where the founder's personal capacity becomes the bottleneck. Good reviews and growing demand without operational systems = the classic "we're growing but drowning" moment. Medium priority because the company may not yet have budget for consulting, but the pain is real and growing.

### Commercial/Industrial Painting Contractors

#### Priority 1

##### Leach Painting Contractors LLC
- **Website:** https://leachpaintingcontractors.com/
- **Size:** <25 employees, 4th generation family business
- **Founded:** 1930s (90+ years)
- **Key People:** Elani Leach (Office Manager — the Backbone), La Leach (President/Co-Owner), Mark Leach (Co-Owner), Kevin McClanahan (Sr Estimator/PM), Andrew Bronner (Sr Field Superintendent)
- **Email:** elani@leachpaintingcontractors.com (INFERRED — pattern: firstname@leachpaintingcontractors.com)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. reCAPTCHA. PHP. Cloudflare CDN. Procore network listing (directory, not user). No CRM, no scheduling, no PM software, no estimating tools.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Contractor license EXPIRED 09-05-2025** (CBRC008552) — administrative processes falling through cracks
  - Zero public reviews despite 90+ year history — no reputation management
  - Not BBB accredited
- **Why:** When a 90-year-old, 4th-generation painting contractor lets their license expire, it tells you the administrative systems are overwhelmed. Elani Leach (Office Manager) is the Backbone persona — she's juggling licensing, compliance, scheduling, and customer communication, and things are slipping. The expired license is a concrete, verifiable pain signal you can reference in outreach.

##### Lehn Painting Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.lehnpainting.com/
- **Size:** ~46 employees, ~$3.9M revenue
- **Founded:** 1986 (40 years)
- **Key People:** William R. Lehn (President/Founder), David Lehn, Daryl Smith (PM), Nicholas Collins (PM & Estimator — confirmed email: ncollins@lehnpainting.com), Kendra Corsmeier (HR/Payroll Admin), Connie Hay (Payroll Admin)
- **Email:** ncollins@lehnpainting.com (CONFIRMED)
- **Tech Stack:** Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (ERP — likely underutilized). Microsoft Exchange Online. WordPress/Yoast. No construction mgmt software, no CRM, no customer portal. Careers page but no ATS.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Customer: **paint overspray on truck at college job caused $5,000 damage** — insurance wouldn't cover it
  - Two payroll admins but no Ops Manager title — payroll-heavy but operations-light staffing
  - Not BBB accredited ("insufficient info")
  - DOT fleet registration (FMCSA DOT #3049945) adds compliance burden without fleet management software
- **Why:** Lehn is the largest prospect in this batch and has D365 Business Central — but the ERP is almost certainly used only for accounting/payroll while the rest of operations runs on spreadsheets and phone calls. Two payroll admins, zero ops managers, and a DOT fleet with no fleet management software = a company that has invested in financial systems but not operational systems. Nicholas Collins is the confirmed contact point.

##### Hy-Blast Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.hyblastinc.com/
- **Size:** ~16 employees, ~$1.4M revenue
- **Founded:** 1977 (49 years), 3rd generation (Cunningham family)
- **Key People:** Bob Cunningham (President/Co-Owner, 40+ yrs), Tom Cunningham (Co-Owner), Don Cunningham (Co-Owner), Nic Cunningham (VP/Operations Manager — 3rd gen, joined 2013)
- **Email:** nic@hyblastinc.com (INFERRED); info@hyblastinc.com (CONFIRMED)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic HTML/template website. info@ generic email. No CRM, no scheduling, no safety management software, no estimating tools. No social media.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor: **"Stay focus on employee safety."** — safety concern at an industrial sandblasting operation
  - $12/hr working interview in industrial sandblasting = below market
  - Three-tier pay structure (working interview → 3-month contract → regular hire) — complex onboarding with no HR system
  - No visible admin staff for 16-person OSHA-regulated operation
- **Why:** An OSHA-regulated industrial sandblasting company with 16 employees, no safety management software, no admin staff, and Glassdoor safety concerns is a compliance time bomb. Nic Cunningham (3rd gen VP) is the person trying to modernize — he joined in 2013 and represents the generational transition. The safety angle is a compelling conversation opener.

#### Priority 2

##### Epoxy Systems Blasting & Coating Inc.
- **Website:** https://epoxy-systems-blast-powder-paint.com/ (also: epoxy-systems.com)
- **Size:** 11-50 employees, <$5M
- **Founded:** ~1978 / incorporated 1997 (25+ years)
- **Key People:** Steve Ferneding (President), Ray Litmer (Owner/Co-Founder/GM — 35+ years coatings industry), Julie Ott (Office Manager)
- **Email:** jott@epoxy-systems.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** PHP 5.6 (end-of-life since 2018!). WordPress. Google Font API. Two separate websites/domains. Fax machine. Alignable profile. No CRM, no scheduling, no PM software, no safety management, no estimating tools.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Two websites + two email domains + two brand names for same company (fragmented operations)
  - Fax (513-924-1900) still active
  - **PHP 5.6** (end-of-life since December 2018) — running 8-year-old unsupported web software
  - Indeed employee loves travel work — adds logistical complexity for small office
  - Not BBB accredited despite 25+ years
- **Why:** The PHP 5.6 website is a perfect metaphor for the whole company: built on technology from a previous era and never updated. Two websites, two domains, two brand names, a fax machine, and no operational software. Julie Ott (Office Manager) is the Backbone trying to hold this together. Ray Litmer has 35+ years of industry knowledge locked in his head. Medium priority because the fragmented brand identity suggests possible ownership/leadership alignment issues.

### Electrical Contractors

#### Priority 1

##### Cooper Electric
- **Website:** https://cooper-electric.net/
- **Size:** ~28 employees, ~$4-6M
- **Founded:** ~1948 (78-year-old company)
- **Key People:** Gregory T. Hyland (President), Gil Hyland (GM/Biz Dev), Brian Brinker (Service Manager — single point of failure for dispatch), Ted Wright (PM/Estimator since 1989)
- **Email:** ghyland@cooper-electric.net (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. Owner's personal free WordPress.com blog. Manual 24hr phone answering. No FSM software, no online scheduling, no dispatch platform. PPP via community bank.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor 3.1/5 (55% would NOT recommend)
  - **"Lied about job functions."** — Glassdoor employee review
  - **"Work us like dogs and give 3% raises."** — Glassdoor
  - Yelp: **"Called 8x — they give the run around and never call back."**
  - Scheduling acknowledged as a challenge even by positive reviewers
- **Why:** A 78-year-old, ~28-employee electrical contractor with a 3.1 Glassdoor rating and customers reporting they "called 8 times" with no callback. Brian Brinker (Service Manager) is the sole dispatch point — if he's busy, calls don't get returned. The Hyland family runs the company (Gregory = President, Gil = GM) with Ted Wright doing estimating since 1989. This is a company with the revenue and size to invest in operations but has never had anyone show them how.

##### Premiere Electric
- **Website:** https://www.premiereelectriccompany.com/
- **Size:** ~6 employees, ~$600K-1.2M
- **Founded:** ~1990 (36 years)
- **Key People:** Tom Baynum (Owner — also the dispatcher), Jamie (VP/Co-Owner — does all admin/data entry)
- **Email:** tom@premiereelec.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** HubSpot CMS (blog). No FSM software, no online scheduling, no dispatch. Customers text owner directly. Manual data entry by VP. NKY Chamber member.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Owner IS the dispatcher** — customers text Tom's personal phone directly
  - Jamie (VP/Co-Owner) does manual data entry for everything
  - PPP only $30K (confirms very small payroll)
  - Owner still in the field doing work at a 36-year-old business
- **Why:** When customers text the owner's personal phone to schedule electrical work, you know there's no dispatch system. Tom Baynum is in the field doing work, answering his phone between jobs, while Jamie manually enters everything. At 36 years old, this business should have outgrown this model. Jamie is the Backbone persona. At the low end of the size range — may have limited budget but the pain is acute.

#### Priority 2

##### Hayes Electric Services
- **Website:** https://hayeselectricservices.com/
- **Size:** ~5-15 employees
- **Founded:** 2010 (16 years)
- **Key People:** Keith Hayes (President/Owner — Master Electrician since 1995)
- **Email:** keith@hayeselectricservices.com (CONFIRMED)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic template website. No FSM software, no online scheduling, no dispatch. Owner email as primary contact. No app or customer portal.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Owner-operated with extremely broad service list for small team (electrical + networks + home theater + landscape lighting)
  - BBB has insufficient info to rate (no accreditation)
  - 16 years old with only 11 Yelp reviews — purely word-of-mouth growth
  - No employee reviews anywhere
- **Why:** A broad service list for a small team means Keith Hayes is spreading his crew thin across residential electrical, low voltage, networking, home theater, and landscape lighting — with no dispatch or scheduling system to coordinate it all. Medium priority due to unclear employee count and purely word-of-mouth growth suggesting the company may not be actively seeking to scale.

### Drywall Contractors

#### Priority 1

##### Cincinnati Drywall Inc.
- **Website:** https://cincinnati-drywall.com/ (also: cincinnatidrywall.net, cincydrywallinc.com)
- **Size:** 11-50 employees, ~$5.2M revenue
- **Founded:** 1973 (53 years, multi-generational family)
- **Key People:** Philip (Michael) Mott (President), Jo Mott (Office Manager — the Backbone), Jacob Gundler (VP — younger generation)
- **Email:** cincinnatidrywall@gmail.com (CONFIRMED — publicly listed on Yelp and directories)
- **Tech Stack:** **Gmail as primary business email** for a $5.2M company. Three separate website domains with no consolidation. LinkedIn page lists 2-10 employees (unmaintained). No CRM, no scheduling, no PM software, no estimating tools, no online booking.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Angi customer: **"The work performed was merely average at best with inadequate feathering at many joints and lots of pin holes."** — good people, inconsistent execution = no QC system
  - T&M pricing used as scheduling workaround — customers who accept T&M get faster scheduling because estimating is a bottleneck for fixed-price work
  - Three separate website domains = fragmented digital presence with no strategy
  - Gmail for a $5.2M company = no email infrastructure whatsoever
- **Why:** Cincinnati Drywall is the #1 drywall prospect. A 53-year-old, $5.2M family business using cincinnatidrywall@gmail.com as their primary contact. Jo Mott runs the entire office — scheduling, invoicing, customer communication — for a company with 11-50 employees. The T&M scheduling workaround reveals the estimating pipeline is broken. Three website domains confirm no digital strategy. Customer reviews show quality inconsistency that's classic "no standardized processes." Jo Mott is the textbook Backbone.

##### Pro-Grade Drywall LLC
- **Website:** https://progradedrywall.com/
- **Size:** 5-15 employees
- **Founded:** LLC filed 2020; team has 30+ years combined experience
- **Key People:** Steve Smiley (Owner), Brad Evans (GM/Estimator — BEvansdw10@gmail.com CONFIRMED), Ross Fry (Admin/Accounting/Marketing — one person doing three jobs), Tyler Warren (Painting Services)
- **Email:** stevesmiley442@gmail.com (CONFIRMED — on website)
- **Tech Stack:** Personal Gmail for owner AND GM. No domain email. No CRM, no scheduling, no PM tools, no estimating software. Template website. Personal cell phones as business lines.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Website: **"Owner is involved in every aspect of the project."** — marketed as feature, operationally a bottleneck
  - One person (Ross Fry) handles ALL admin + accounting + marketing
  - Both owner and GM use personal Gmail (@gmail.com, not @progradedrywall.com)
  - BBB accredited only 11/24/2025 — 3 months ago, late professionalization
  - Almost zero online reviews despite 30+ years experience
- **Why:** Pro-Grade is in the dangerous growth phase: expanding services (drywall, painting, acoustical, flooring) with zero operational infrastructure. The owner does everything, one person handles all back-office functions, and everyone uses personal Gmail. They just got BBB accredited — they know they need to professionalize but are starting with credentials before systems. Steve Smiley is a Reluctant Operator; Ross Fry is an overloaded Backbone doing three jobs.

#### Priority 2

##### Bosse Drywall Inc.
- **Website:** https://bossedrywall.com/
- **Size:** 10-25 employees
- **Founded:** 1962 (64 years, family-owned)
- **Key People:** Patrick D. Hillman (Owner/President) — sole visible leader
- **Email:** pat@bossedrywall.com (INFERRED — ZoomInfo partial reveal)
- **Tech Stack:** Domain email (single owner inbox). **Active fax line** (513-825-2025). No scheduling, no CRM, no PM software, no online booking, no customer portal. Template website.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Yahoo Local review: **"I called the number listed, twice, and was hung up on twice."** — field workers answering phones on job sites
  - Website: **"We strive to be in constant communication with our customers"** — aspiration contradicted by phone handling reality
  - Active fax line in 2026
  - No visible operations/admin staff beyond the owner for a 60+ year company
- **Why:** Bosse is a 64-year institution in Cincinnati drywall with employees averaging 12+ year tenure and BBB A+ for 38 years. Pat Hillman is the sole visible leader. The "hung up on twice" review perfectly captures the gap between the owner's values and the company's operational capacity. The fax line and owner-only front office confirm this is a company running on relationships and memory. Medium priority because stability may breed resistance to change.

##### McCool Plaster & Drywall Inc.
- **Website:** https://mccoolplasteranddrywall.com/
- **Size:** 11-50 employees, ~$6.3M revenue
- **Founded:** 1996 (30 years, mother-and-sons operation)
- **Key People:** Ruth Ann McCool (President — office/admin), Gary McCool (Estimator), Tim McCool (Estimator), Ron McCool (Plasterer Foreman), Lance McCool (Field Superintendent)
- **Email:** gary@mccoolplasteranddrywall.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** Domain email but not published anywhere — contact form only. No PM software, no estimating tools, no customer portal. DOT registered (fleet). Website is better than most prospects (some willingness to invest).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **All 5 leadership positions held by McCool family members** — zero non-family managers for a $6.3M operation
  - No published email address — $6.3M commercial company forces GCs to use a contact form
  - Zero Levelset payment data for a 30-year company — no digital payment tracking
  - HomeAdvisor review: **"They are not the cheapest but you get what you pay for"** — pricing by gut feel, not data
- **Why:** McCool is a $6.3M company where Ruth Ann (President/office), Gary and Tim (estimating), Ron (plastering), and Lance (field) handle everything as a family unit. No non-family management for a company doing complex commercial work (EIFS, acoustical, metal framing, ornamental plaster). The DOT registration adds fleet compliance to Ruth Ann's workload. Medium priority because the better-than-average website suggests some professionalism investment, but the underlying operations are entirely family-dependent and manual.

### Disqualified — Batch 5

- **Echler Electric** — Too small (1-4 employees, ~$500K-1M). Owner-built Squarespace site with unfinished pages. 20 years in business at 1-4 employees = zero operational scaling. Quality work (BuildZoom top 16%) but below size threshold for ops consulting ROI.
- **Valley Interior Systems** — Too large (550-1,000+ employees, $110M-$764M revenue, 7+ offices across OH/KY/TN).
- **The Patch Boys of Cincinnati** — National franchise (BELFOR Franchise Group).
- **M & E Drywall Finishing LLC** — Too small (~2 employees, ~$100K revenue).
- **JH Drywall Cincinnati** — Insufficient data / likely too small. Possibly fabricated testimonials.
- **Keen Drywall** — Likely too small (owner + field workers, no organizational structure).
- **Drywall Cincy** — Insufficient data / likely too small.
- **Mr. Handyman of Greater Cincinnati & NKY** — National franchise (Neighborly/Frontdoor Inc.).
- **Express Renovations LLC** — Insufficient data (since 1996, but no size/owner data found).

## CONSTRUCTION/TRADES — BATCH 6 EXPANSION: Roofing, Solar, Gutters, Windows/Siding

**Added 2026-02-12 | +13 new prospects | Running total: 214/500**

### Roofing Contractors

#### Priority 1

##### Ford & Son Roofing Co.
- **Website:** https://ford-roofing.com/
- **Size:** 10-25 employees
- **Founded:** 1945 (79 years, 3rd generation — Owen Brown → Tyrone "Ty" Ford Brown → Charles Brown)
- **Key People:** Charles Brown (Owner/President, 3rd gen), Tyrone "Ty" Ford Brown (2nd gen, semi-retired)
- **Email:** fordroofingcompany@yahoo.com (CONFIRMED — on BBB); info@ford-roofing.com (CONFIRMED — website generic)
- **Tech Stack:** **Yahoo email for business** (!). WordPress. Two websites (fragmented). No CRM, no scheduling, no PM tools. Recently adopted some quoting tool but no integration.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Yahoo email as primary business contact in 2026** — one of the strongest tech-lag signals in the entire prospect database
  - Customer noted **"a great online estimate and invoice system"** (Angi) — suggesting piecemeal tool adoption with no integration
  - Owner "oversees all aspects" per LinkedIn — classic bottleneck
  - No visible office manager or ops staff for a 10-25 employee company
- **Why:** The Yahoo email tells the whole story. A 79-year-old, 3rd-generation roofing company with 10-25 employees using fordroofingcompany@yahoo.com has never been approached with a modern operations framework. Charles Brown is the Reluctant Operator — he inherited a legacy business and is running it the way it's always been run. The piecemeal quoting tool adoption shows awareness but no strategy.

##### Campbell Roofing
- **Website:** https://www.roofingandersontownshipoh.com/
- **Size:** 5-15 employees
- **Founded:** 1992 (30+ years)
- **Key People:** Greg Campbell (Owner — does everything personally)
- **Email:** greg@roofingandersontownshipoh.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** SEO-keyword-stuffed domain (built by agency). No visible CRM, scheduling, or PM tools. No email published. Phone-first contact.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Customer (Angi): **"Mr. Campbell does not use starter shingles when installing roofs, which voids the manufacturer's warranty"** — process gap
  - Customer: **"damage to gutters and a light that was ripped down and stuck back with screws without being told"** — communication breakdown between field crews and customers
  - Greg Campbell personally handles every QC callback after 30 years — owner bottleneck
  - BBB A+ but documented complaints about installation quality consistency
- **Why:** After 30+ years, Greg Campbell is still personally doing QC callbacks, customer communication, and likely scheduling. No office manager visible anywhere. The crew damage complaint that wasn't communicated to the customer is a textbook field-to-office communication failure. Greg knows his trade but has never built operational systems around it.

##### The Affordable Roofing Company (TARC Roofing & Remodeling)
- **Website:** https://theaffordableroofingco.com/
- **Size:** 5-15 employees
- **Founded:** 2010 (~16 years)
- **Key People:** Will Smith (Owner/Founder — also runs Austere Provisions on the side)
- **Email:** will@theaffordableroofingco.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress basic. No CRM, no scheduling, no dispatch, no fleet management. Contact form only. Not BBB accredited.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Serves **Cincinnati, Dayton, NKY, AND Columbus** — massive 4-market geography for a small team with no visible dispatch
  - Owner runs a **second business** (Austere Provisions) — split attention
  - Left corporate **"to be with family"** but now trapped managing multi-market roofing co
  - **10-year labor warranty with free annual inspection each spring** — creates recurring scheduling nightmare without software
- **Why:** Will Smith is the quintessential Reluctant Operator: left corporate life for family time, now more trapped than ever managing a 4-market roofing company with no ops infrastructure plus a side business. The annual inspection warranty creates hundreds of recurring scheduling obligations that without software become a logistical nightmare. Not BBB accredited and no public email confirm zero investment in business infrastructure.

#### Priority 2

##### Riegler Contracting LLC
- **Website:** https://www.rieglercontracting.com/
- **Size:** 8-20 employees
- **Founded:** ~2018-2020
- **Key People:** Dylan Riegler (Founder/Owner), Aaron (VP of Operations), Garey (Project Manager), Jake/Joey/Jerricoh (Sales Reps)
- **Email:** info@rieglercontracting.com (CONFIRMED); dylan@rieglercontracting.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** Squarespace. No visible CRM or scheduling. Has VP of Ops + PM but likely no systems to support them.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Owner **"oversees all aspects of the company including project planning material selection team management and customer service"** — even with VP of Ops hired
  - BBB complaint: **"8 long months"** on a project
  - Residential HQ address (Bleu Yacht Ln) — revenue outpacing infrastructure
  - 300+ five-star reviews — growing fast without ops systems
- **Why:** Riegler has done something unusual: hired a VP of Operations and a PM. But if Aaron is managing operations without proper systems, he's drowning. The pitch here is that people alone don't solve process problems — systems do. Dylan is still doing everything despite having hired ops staff. Medium priority because they may believe they've already "solved" ops.

### Solar / Renewable Energy

#### Priority 1

##### Icon Solar Power LLC
- **Website:** https://iconsolar.com/
- **Size:** 18-21 employees
- **Founded:** 2009 (16+ years)
- **Key People:** Zach Wieber (Director of Operations / Partner), Paula Hensley (admin/sales)
- **Email:** zach@iconsolar.com (INFERRED — ZoomInfo shows z***@iconsolar.com); info@iconsolar.com (generic)
- **Tech Stack:** Custom website (Half Full Marketing). Google Tag Manager. Generic info@ email. No visible CRM or scheduling. No customer portal.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Company admitted: **"Their service ticket was lost in their system, and they had no record of any communication (telephone or email) with the customer."** — SolarReviews.com (regarding 6-month wait for micro-inverter replacement)
  - **"After paying a deposit, Icon Solar was not very responsive when contacted about installation timing... it took longer than expected"** — SolarReviews
  - **"Never received the promised app to track the process, not receiving invoices but getting calls about late payments"** — SolarReviews (Icon Power sister entity)
  - BBB A+ rating masks the review-site pain signals
- **Why:** Icon Solar's own public admission that a service ticket was "lost in their system" with "no record of any communication" is the single best outreach hook in this entire batch. Zach Wieber as Director of Operations is the exact buyer persona — he's the one who has to explain to customers why tickets get lost. The company is right in the sweet spot (18-21 employees) with clear, documented systems failures.

#### Priority 2

##### Paff Electric & Solar
- **Website:** https://www.paffelectricandsolar.com/
- **Size:** ~7 employees
- **Founded:** ~1986 (40+ years as electrical; solar added recently; Monica Williams owner since 2016)
- **Key People:** Monica Williams (Owner, WBE/SBE certified), Nick (scheduling/comms), Josh/Cody (crew leads)
- **Email:** monicawilliams@paffelectricandsolar.com (CONFIRMED — ZoomInfo)
- **Tech Stack:** Professional website. Domain email. No visible CRM or scheduling. NECA/IBEW union shop.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Angi: **"Got ghosted when I provided info regarding the work I needed done."** — leads falling through cracks
  - Scheduling delays and lack of follow-up on smaller jobs
  - Google 4.1/5 on only 12 reviews — inconsistent experience
  - Small team adding solar to legacy electrical = increased ops complexity
- **Why:** Paff is a 40-year electrical shop adding solar services — a significant increase in operational complexity (permitting, inspections, utility coordination, equipment ordering) layered on top of an already-stretched 7-person team. Monica Williams as owner-operator likely manages scheduling, customer comms, and crew dispatch personally. At the low end of size range.

##### Solar Energy Solutions (SES)
- **Website:** https://www.sesre.com/
- **Size:** 11-50 employees (multi-state: Cincinnati, Lexington, Louisville, Bloomington)
- **Founded:** 2006 (oldest regional solar installer, 20 years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Fran Lockwood (President)
- **Email:** team@sesre.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Professional website. Domain email. ESOP. Tesla Powerwall certified. Multi-location.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor employee: **"A lack of communication and accountability paired with inconsistent information management contributes negatively to the work/life balance."**
  - **"Inconsistent information management"** — red flag for fragmented data systems
  - Actively hiring HR Manager — growing past informal processes
  - ESOP transition adds administrative complexity
- **Why:** The Glassdoor review citing "inconsistent information management" strongly suggests fragmented operational systems across multiple locations. ESOP transition and HR hiring signal a formalization inflection point. At the upper end of target sophistication — may be further along than ideal Ops for Shops client.

### Gutter Companies

#### Priority 1

##### Cincy Gutter Boys
- **Website:** https://cincygutterboys.com/
- **Size:** 8-18 employees (seasonal)
- **Founded:** 2006 (~20 years)
- **Key People:** Jesse Carpenter (Founder), Shane McDonough (Co-Owner)
- **Email:** office@cincygutterboys.com (CONFIRMED — generic "office@" is itself a tech signal)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. Generic office@ email. Thumbtack/HomeAdvisor/Angi for leads. No visible CRM or scheduling.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: **"It has been 6 weeks since I reported the problem and I am still waiting. They said they would return in 2 weeks."**
  - BBB: **"I've waited 4 weeks for them to come out to clean out my gutters, so I cancelled."**
  - BBB: **"We were told a Manager would give me a call back... Weeks passed and no one ever called us."**
  - BBB: **"Nobody ever came to our door or let alone our house on the supposed 'date of service'... sending us to collections"** — dispatching + billing system failure
  - BBB: **"Not cashing checks in a timely manner"** — accounts receivable breakdown
  - Indeed employee: **"Management is unresponsive, there's no opportunity for growth despite promises, no benefits"**
  - Crew missed an entire side of a house during cleaning — QC checklist gap
- **Why:** Cincy Gutter Boys is drowning in operational pain. Scheduling failures, lost callbacks, billing errors, dispatching mistakes, and incorrect collections are all documented in BBB complaints. The volume and specificity of complaints point to manual processes breaking down under load — not bad intentions. At 8-18 seasonal employees with dual owners, they are squarely in the sweet spot. This may be the single most pain-dense prospect in the entire database.

##### The Gutter Magician of Northern Kentucky
- **Website:** https://guttermagiciannky.com/
- **Size:** 10-20 employees
- **Founded:** ~2003 (22+ years)
- **Key People:** Doug Verst (Owner/President — wears every hat)
- **Email:** doug@guttermagiciannky.com (INFERRED — ZoomInfo partial d***@)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic website (some pages still HTTP!). iHeart Radio ads (traditional media). Birdeye for reviews. HomeAdvisor/Angi. No visible CRM or scheduling.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: **"Installer showed up to tear off old gutters... but the rest of the installation crew was finishing another job... they never made it to the customer's house that day."** — crew scheduling conflict
  - BBB: **"The crew didn't show up until late afternoon (around 4:30 pm)"** — route management issues
  - BBB: **"Reactions to concerns and complaints are mean and insulting"** — no formal complaint handling
  - 3.0 stars Yelp vs 4.0 Birdeye — inconsistent review presence
- **Why:** A 22-year-old business where the owner personally calls customers about crew arrivals because there's no automated notification system. Crew scheduling conflicts and rescheduling complaints indicate manual dispatching. Doug Verst is the classic founder who built a great business but is now the bottleneck for everything.

#### Priority 2

##### Anderson Gutter Company
- **Website:** https://www.andersonguttercompany.com/
- **Size:** 2-10 employees (small, founder + wife + crew)
- **Founded:** 2014 (10+ years)
- **Key People:** Doug Martin (Owner), Julie Martin (wife, involved in ops)
- **Email:** Not published (phone-only contact — strong signal)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic template website. Instagram. Nextdoor. GuildQuality for reviews. No email published. No CRM. No scheduling.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - HomeAdvisor: **"Doug was very flexible with scheduling"** — translation: Doug IS the scheduling system
  - Started from home with single truck, grown to warehouse + multiple trucks + dedicated team — growth without ops infrastructure
  - No email published anywhere — phone-only contact
  - Screws/nails left in driveway getting into car tire — QC checklist gap
- **Why:** Anderson is earlier in its growth curve but showing classic founder-dependency. Doug Martin personally handles estimates, scheduling, and customer calls. No visible operational technology. At the low end of size range — nurture prospect for when they grow to 10+. The phone-only model is unsustainable.

### Window / Siding Contractors

#### Priority 1

##### Windows Plus
- **Website:** https://www.windowspluscincinnati.com/
- **Size:** ~11-15 employees
- **Founded:** 1982 (42+ years)
- **Key People:** Dennis Morris (Owner — single point of contact)
- **Email:** dmorris@windowspluscincinnati.com (CONFIRMED — BBB and dealer listing)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic CMS/WordPress. GuildQuality for reviews (old-school). No visible scheduling, CRM, or chat.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB (2024-2025): **"Someone would call the following week, but no one did... still waiting for someone to correct the problem and had still received no response."**
  - Yelp: **"Waited 3 months for the work with no updates or phone calls"**
  - Installer **"missed one window entirely, installed one upside down, jammed wood under a transom window instead of ordering correct piece"**
  - BBB: **"Four months for a window to be ready, two visits for measurement, and the wrong size was ordered and installed anyway"**
- **Why:** Windows Plus is a 42-year-old business showing repeated patterns of dropped callbacks, months-long scheduling gaps, and order/measurement errors. These are textbook symptoms of manual tracking with no CRM or job management software. Dennis Morris is the single contact point for an 11-15 employee operation — classic flat org with no ops layer.

##### Sterling Exteriors
- **Website:** https://sterling-exteriors.com/
- **Size:** 10-25 employees (growing, actively hiring)
- **Founded:** ~2008-2010 (15+ years)
- **Key People:** Brad Olinger (Owner & President), Justin Eno (insurance claims/ops), Cory Toepfert (possible co-founder)
- **Email:** brad@sterling-exteriors.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress-style template. Domain email. Birdeye for reviews. No ATS. No online scheduling. No customer portal. Static careers page.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Angi: **"Disappointment in the communication skills and professionalism displayed by Sterling, with many delays in completion"**
  - Yelp: **"Craftsmanship is horrendous and customer service egregious — continued leaks despite multiple repair attempts"**
  - Active hiring + "tremendous growth" with no ATS — scaling without systems
  - Late BBB accreditation (2022, despite 15+ years) — late professionalization
- **Why:** Sterling is in a growth phase with "tremendous growth" and active hiring but no operational tooling — no ATS, no scheduling, no customer portal. Communication delay complaints and repeated repair visits suggest no job-tracking or QC follow-through system. Brad Olinger is the decision-maker at the right company size for Ops for Shops.

#### Priority 2

##### Superior Products Exteriors Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.superiorproducts-exteriors.com/
- **Size:** 20-49 employees (multi-entity)
- **Founded:** 1997 (BBB since 1999, ~28 years)
- **Key People:** John Wilson (Co-Owner), W. Peter McCrackan (Co-Owner)
- **Email:** jwilson@superiorproducts-exteriors.com (INFERRED)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic Wix-style website. No online scheduling, chat, or CRM. Contact form only. Unclaimed Glassdoor profile. Multiple LLCs under same ownership.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor employee: **"Produce your own appt"** and **"knocking on doors"** — no lead management system
  - Owners run **5 related companies** (Superior Products, NuVue, Froelich, J. Baer, McGrath & Co) — multi-entity complexity with likely manual coordination
  - Unclaimed Glassdoor profile — not monitoring employer brand
- **Why:** The 5-company portfolio under Wilson/McCrackan is the unique angle. Operational consolidation across multiple entities is a compelling pitch — they're almost certainly managing 5 companies with 5 separate spreadsheets. Harder to reach (no public email, no named ops person) and may have slower decision-making.

### Disqualified — Batch 6

**Roofing:**
- **Bone Dry Roofing** — Franchise operation.
- **Deer Park Roofing** — Too large (125+ employees, 3 locations).
- **Long Roofing** — National chain.
- **Roof Maxx** — Franchise.
- **David Saner Roofing** — Too small (1-2 employees).
- **Lady on the Roof** — Too small (2-3 employees).
- **Apply Rite Roofing** — Likely too small (1-10, probably at lower end).

**Solar:**
- **Blue Raven Solar** — National chain (acquired by SunPower, then Complete Solaria).
- **Melink Solar / Melink Corporation** — Too large (100+ employees, ~$37M).
- **Sustainergy Cooperative** — Worker-owned cooperative, likely too small.
- **TMI Energy Solutions** — Appears operationally mature (licensed engineers, PMs).
- **SunPower, Tesla Solar, Vivint Solar, Pink Energy** — National chains.

**Gutters:**
- **The Brothers That Just Do Gutters** — National franchise (Evive Brands, 300+ locations).
- **LeafFilter** — National chain.
- **LeafGuard** — National brand/franchise.
- **Gutter Helmet (Ray St. Clair)** — Independent but 100+ employees (too large).
- **Mollett Gutter Company** — Subsidiary of Installed Building Products (publicly traded).
- **All American Gutter Protection** — National chain.
- **Gutter Shutter** — National brand/dealer network.
- **Loper Seamless Gutters** — Too new/small (founded 2021, husband-wife).
- **Cincinnati Gutter Pros** — Insufficient data.

**Windows/Siding:**
- **Window World of Cincinnati** — National franchise.
- **Renewal by Andersen** — National chain.
- **Champion Windows** — National chain.
- **Pella Windows & Doors** — National brand.
- **Window Depot USA of Cincinnati** — National dealer network (franchise model).
- **Coldstream Exteriors** — Multi-market with COO, more operationally mature than target.
- **Harper Siding & Roofing** — Likely too small (possibly under 5 employees).

## MEDICAL/DENTAL — BATCH 7 EXPANSION: Veterinary Clinics

**Added 2026-02-12 | +14 new prospects | Running total: 228/500**

### Industry Context

Veterinary clinics are ideal Ops for Shops prospects because the owner-DVMs want to practice medicine, not manage operations. Most independent clinics have 8-25 staff (DVMs + techs + front desk) and run on a patchwork of practice management software, phone-based scheduling, and manual processes. Corporate consolidation (Mars/VCA, NVA, Pathway, Thrive, PetVet, Heartland, Mission) has acquired thousands of practices, but Cincinnati still has a strong independent clinic base. Key pain signals: phone-only scheduling overwhelming front desk, hour-long wait times, billing friction, staff burnout/turnover, fragmented client communication tools (PetDesk bolted on top of legacy systems), and owner-DVMs who never planned to be business managers. The "Backbone" persona is the Practice Manager/Office Manager; the "Reluctant Operator" is the owner-DVM.

#### Priority 1

##### Montgomery Animal Hospital
- **Website:** https://montgomeryanimalhospital.com/
- **Size:** 3 DVMs + 12-18 total staff, AAHA accredited
- **Founded:** 1940 (84 years, 4th independent owner)
- **Key People:** Dr. Diane Krumanaker (Owner, OSU 2021), Connor (Practice Manager & RVT, 5+ years — the Backbone), CSRs: Margot, Christina, Anna, Jenny
- **Email:** info@montgomeryanimalhospital.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** GeniusVets website. No online booking — phone only. No client portal. CareCredit.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed employee: **"Management is terrible, the entire hospital is unorganized"**
  - Recent ownership transition (~2023-2024) = systems in flux
  - No online booking = 4 CSRs buried in phone calls
- **Why:** A recently acquired practice with a young owner-DVM who wants to focus on medicine. The Indeed review citing disorganization + ownership transition = a practice actively looking for better systems. Connor (Practice Manager) is the ideal first contact — he has institutional knowledge and would immediately see the value in workflow improvements.

##### Glenway Animal Hospital
- **Website:** https://www.glenwayanimalhospital.com/
- **Size:** 2 DVMs + 10-20 total staff, AAHA accredited
- **Founded:** 1995 (Drs. Brian & Diana Cron purchased from Dr. Fred Leininger)
- **Key People:** Dr. Brian Cron (Owner), Dr. Diana Cron (Owner), Michele Mescher (Hospital Administrator & RVT — since July 1996, 30 years! — the Backbone), Becky Hafertepen (CSR), Colleen Steinmetz (CSR since 2012)
- **Email:** info@glenwayanimalhospital.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** GeniusVets website. PetDesk + PetsApp (fragmented — using two competing client communication platforms). Legacy CMS (.pml file extensions). No unified client portal.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Yelp: **"They're always at least an hour behind"**
  - **"Expected to wait 2 weeks to bring a dog in with an ear infection"**
  - **"Desk people are rude"** — front-desk overwhelm, not attitude
  - Using both PetDesk AND PetsApp = fragmented client communications
- **Why:** A husband-wife practice with a 30-year Hospital Administrator (Michele Mescher) who is the operational heart. Hour-behind scheduling, 2-week booking delays, and front-desk friction despite adopting PetDesk AND PetsApp — they're throwing tools at the problem without a strategy. Michele is the ideal first contact.

##### Grants Lick Veterinary Hospital
- **Website:** https://grantslickvet.com/
- **Size:** 4+ DVMs + ~21 total staff, 2 locations (Alexandria KY + Falmouth KY)
- **Founded:** 50+ years ago (new 12,000 sq ft building 2018)
- **Key People:** Dr. Mike Crawley (President/Co-Owner), Dr. Steve Enzweiler (VP/Co-Owner, since 1997), Office Manager "B.C." (name not public)
- **Email:** FLast@grantslickvet.com pattern (RocketReach)
- **Tech Stack:** Modern template website. Online scheduling available. Two locations.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: **"Does not follow their mission statement"** with **"strong undertow of manipulation from long-time employees"**
  - Raises **"supposed to occur once per year, but often don't happen"** — manual HR
  - Hospital **"keeps track when you call in sick, even if you have PTO available"** — manual PTO tracking
  - Doctor accused of **"not utilizing effective client communication"**
- **Why:** A 21-person, two-location practice with clear internal pain. Employee reviews reveal manual HR processes (PTO tracking, inconsistent raises), communication breakdowns, and cultural issues from lack of formal systems. Two locations double every operational inefficiency.

##### Florence Veterinary Hospital
- **Website:** https://florencevethospital.com/
- **Size:** 3+ DVMs + ~20 total staff
- **Founded:** ~1993 (30+ years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Daniel J. Davis (President/Owner), Dr. Paul A. Garofolo (Senior Veterinarian)
- **Email:** info@florencevethospital.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** GeniusVets website. No online booking — phone-based. No client portal. BBB listed Inc.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Yelp: **"Waited 45 minutes after my appointment time to be seen"**
  - **"If you want to pay excessive fees and experience a rude vet, go here"**
  - **"I asked about billing by mail and the vet said he doesn't work for free"** — billing process rigidity
- **Why:** 30-year practice in Boone County NKY with documented wait time and billing friction. Phone-only scheduling for a 20+ staff practice. Billing complaints suggest rigid manual processes.

##### Clermont Animal Hospital
- **Website:** https://www.clermontanimal.net/
- **Size:** 3+ DVMs + 10-20 total staff
- **Founded:** ~1982-1984 (35-42 years, 2nd generation family-owned)
- **Key People:** Dr. Julia B. Esposito (Owner, 2nd generation — father founded), Dr. David J. Stricker (Staff Veterinarian)
- **Email:** Contact form only (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** GeniusVets website. No online booking. 24/7 emergency answering service (traditional, not automated). BBB A+.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **"Significant delays in appointment times... waiting longer than expected without updates"**
  - Self-describes as "smaller practice" — limited admin bandwidth
  - 24/7 emergency call system = after-hours workflow burden
- **Why:** 2nd-generation family practice that has grown organically without modernizing. Wait/communication complaints, phone-only scheduling, traditional emergency answering service. Multi-DVM with revenue to invest.

##### Wards Corner Animal Hospital
- **Website:** https://wardscorneranimalhospital.com/
- **Size:** 2 DVMs + 8-12 total staff
- **Founded:** ~1977 (nearly 50 years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Timothy A. Henehan (Owner, OSU, practicing since 1977), Dr. Mark Wolfer (Associate, joined June 2025 — recent grad)
- **Email:** info@wardscorneranimalhospital.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic template website. No online booking (TopVet confirms "currently unavailable"). Phone-only. CareCredit. Manual payment processing.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Google: **"The front desk staff member was not friendly, appeared irritated during visits and phone calls, and seemed exhausted"** — front desk burnout
  - Ad hoc billing: **"the doctor worked with them regarding payments"** — no standardized billing workflow
  - Recent hire of brand-new vet grad suggests growth or replacement need
- **Why:** Textbook prospect. Nearly 50-year-old practice with exhausted front desk, no online booking, ad hoc billing. Dr. Henehan is approaching succession age (practicing since 1977), creating urgency to systematize before transition. Loveland/Clermont County.

##### Delhi Veterinary Clinic
- **Website:** https://www.delhiveterinaryclinic.com/
- **Size:** 2+ DVMs + 5-12 total staff
- **Founded:** 1980 (Dr. Kirkendall purchased 1999, has been there since 1986)
- **Key People:** Dr. Scott Kirkendall (Owner/President, OSU — at this practice since high school sophomore in 1986)
- **Email:** info@delhiveterinaryclinic.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Legacy CMS (.pml file extensions!). No online booking. No PetDesk/PetsApp. No client portal. Phone-first culture.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Zero online booking — phone-only scheduling
  - Old website CMS (.pml extensions = legacy from early 2000s)
  - Very limited online presence beyond basic website
  - Employment page suggests ongoing hiring needs
- **Why:** West Side Cincinnati. Owner has been at this practice since he was 16 years old (1986) — 40 years. The .pml file extensions on the website tell you everything about the tech posture. Phone-only, no client portal, no PetDesk — this is a practice running exactly as it did in the 1990s. Minimal tech adoption = strong Ops for Shops fit.

##### Liberty Veterinary Hospital
- **Website:** https://libertyvet.net/
- **Size:** 3+ DVMs + 15-25 total staff (medical + boarding + grooming)
- **Founded:** 1998 (27 years, founder-owned)
- **Key People:** Dr. Amy L. Johnstone (Owner/Founder, Xavier BS Biology, OSU DVM 1991), Dr. Adam Ballard (Associate)
- **Email:** info@libertyvet.net (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** GeniusVets or similar. Careers page. AAHA accredited. No PetDesk/PetsApp. Appointment-only scheduling.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Yelp: **"Front desk staff lacking warmth or empathy during critical interactions"** — overwhelmed reception
  - **"Refused to see a stray dog in pain due to being 'too busy'"** — capacity strain
  - Actively hiring Receptionist/CSR on Indeed — confirmed front-desk gap
  - Using Travis & Associates recruiters for DVMs — difficulty filling positions
  - Multi-service (medical + boarding + grooming) = scheduling across service lines
- **Why:** North Cincinnati. Actively hiring reception staff, reviews cite being "too busy" to see patients, front-desk complaints signal system overload. Multi-service practice multiplies scheduling complexity. 27-year founder-owner who may not have modernized operations.

#### Priority 2

##### Animal Hospital of Delhi Hills
- **Website:** https://animalhospitalofdelhihills.com/
- **Size:** 2-3 DVMs + 10-15 total staff
- **Founded:** Long-established; Dr. Larew purchased February 2020 (mid-pandemic)
- **Key People:** Dr. Lesley Larew (Owner, OSU 2002), Dr. Ashley Drop (Associate, Ross University), Kyle (senior staff/supervisor)
- **Pain Signals:** Wait time complaints, purchased right before COVID = massive disruption during transition, no visible Practice Manager
- **Why:** COVID-era acquisition creates empathy hook. Less acute pain than HIGH-priority prospects but operational gaps likely exist.

##### Deer Park Veterinary Hospital
- **Website:** https://www.dpvh.net/
- **Size:** 2 DVMs + 10-15 total staff (medicine + boarding + grooming)
- **Founded:** 1984 (Dr. Adam Miller purchased, joined 2019)
- **Key People:** Dr. Adam Miller (Owner — Purdue dual degree Business + DVM), Dr. Beth Natale (Associate), Gabby (Lead CSR promoted 2023), Elli (RVT since 2007)
- **Pain Signals:** No online booking, pricing complaints, multi-service complexity, long staff tenure = possibly entrenched processes
- **Why:** Dr. Miller's business degree makes him potentially more receptive but also means he may think he has it handled. Multi-service model creates complexity.

##### NKY Animal Care Center
- **Website:** https://nkyanimalcarecenter.com/
- **Size:** 2+ DVMs + 10-15 total staff
- **Founded:** Established (exact date unclear, experienced DVMs)
- **Key People:** Dr. Jeff Casson, Dr. Kirk Weber (60+ years combined experience)
- **Pain Signals:** Fewer documented complaints, small practice likely running lean with manual processes
- **Why:** Kenton County independent with experienced vets. Good for general ops audit approach rather than specific pain-point pitch.

##### Fort Mitchell Veterinary Center
- **Website:** https://www.fortmitchellvetcenter.com/
- **Size:** 2 DVMs + 8-15 total staff
- **Founded:** 2015 (youngest practice in batch)
- **Key People:** Dr. Ryan Olexia (Owner/Founder), Dr. Abby Schuster (Associate, OSU 2009)
- **Pain Signals:** Very few (4.9 stars, 250 reviews, "always timely"). Founded 2015 — may be more operationally modern.
- **Why:** Kenton County. Softer outreach — growth/scaling angle rather than fixing pain. Dr. Olexia is clear decision-maker.

##### Mike's Mobile Veterinary Service
- **Website:** https://www.mikesmobilevet.com/
- **Size:** 3-5 employees (very small)
- **Founded:** 15+ years (Dr. Cohen practicing since 1992)
- **Key People:** Dr. Mike Cohen (Owner, Ross University 1992, Past President Miami Valley VMA), Ellie (Office Manager), Jim (Vet Assistant)
- **Pain Signals:** 308 reviews with 3 people managing everything by phone. Mobile practice = inherently complex scheduling (routing, time windows, geography). No online booking.
- **Why:** Fascinating niche with inherent scheduling complexity. At low end of size range (3-5) — may be below engagement threshold. Nurture prospect.

##### West Chester Veterinary Center
- **Website:** https://www.wcvetcenter.com/
- **Size:** 2+ DVMs + 10-20 total staff
- **Founded:** 10+ years (Dr. Reno, OSU 2005)
- **Key People:** Dr. Elizabeth Reno (Owner — previously managed emergency/surgical center in Arizona)
- **Pain Signals:** Extended hours (8am-8pm M-Sat, 10am-6pm Sun) = 70+ hrs/week scheduling burden. Hiring via recruiters. PetsApp adopted but not deep.
- **Why:** 7-day operations with small team creates massive scheduling complexity. Fewer concrete review pain signals. North Cincinnati.

### Disqualified — Batch 7

**Corporate-owned (excluded per criteria):**
- **Banfield Pet Hospital** (multiple locations) — Mars Petcare subsidiary
- **VCA Animal Hospitals** (multiple locations) — Mars Petcare subsidiary
- **BluePearl** — Mars Petcare (emergency/specialty)
- **Erlanger Veterinary Hospital** — Acquired by Encore Vet Group (2021), PE-backed (North Castle Partners)
- **PetVet365 Florence** — Corporate chain
- **Noah's Ark Animal Clinics** — Regional chain, multiple locations
- **Lap of Love** — National franchise (in-home euthanasia/hospice)

**Too small / insufficient data:**
- **Heineke Veterinary Hospital** (Alexandria KY) — Single-doctor practice, likely under 5 employees
- **Edgewood Animal Clinic** — One-doctor practice, too small
- **Homeridge Mobile Veterinary** — Insufficient evidence of independent ownership

**Other:**
- **Queen City Veterinary Clinic** — Founded 2025, opened Jan 2026 (too new, under 2 years)
- **UCAN Cincinnati** — Non-profit spay/neuter clinic
- **Care Center Veterinarians** — Large emergency/specialty center, likely exceeds 80 employees
- **Grady Veterinary Hospital** — 24-hour emergency hospital only
- **Plum Street Pet Clinic** — Could not confirm independent ownership
- **Hyde Park Veterinary Clinic** — Could not confirm ownership; modern tech stack suggests lower fit
- **Eastside Animal Hospital** — Could not confirm independent vs. corporate ownership
- **Cincinnati Family Veterinary Services** — IVPA member (confirmed independent) but relatively tech-forward

## MEDICAL/DENTAL — BATCH 8 EXPANSION: PT/OT, Urgent Care, Behavioral Health, Optometry

**Added 2026-02-12 | +14 new prospects | Running total: 242/500**

### Physical Therapy / Occupational Therapy

#### Priority 1

##### Guenthner Physical Therapy Inc.
- **Website:** https://guenthnerpt.com/
- **Size:** ~10-15 employees, 2 locations (White Oak + Bridgetown)
- **Founded:** 1989 (35+ years)
- **Key People:** Cathy Guenthner PT (Owner/President/Founder), Jessica White PT (clinic contact), Kate Armstrong PT (joined 2018), Jenny Fox DPT (orthopedic specialist)
- **Email:** info@guenthnerpt.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic WordPress. No online scheduling. No patient portal. EMR + Excel/Word for admin. Phone/fax-based intake.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Actively hiring admin assistant** — job requires **"experience in electronic medical records, Excel, Word, scheduling patients, and collecting patient information"** — signals manual processes and front-desk bottlenecks
  - No online scheduling, 2 locations with small staff
  - Not BBB accredited at either location (separate BBB profiles = inconsistent identity)
- **Why:** Classic sweet-spot: owner-operated since 1989, 2 locations, visibly low-tech (Excel/Word for admin), actively hiring admin help. The job posting explicitly describes the manual-process pain Ops for Shops solves.

##### Blake & Associates Physical Therapy
- **Website:** https://blakeandassociatespt.com/
- **Size:** ~15-22 employees, single location
- **Founded:** 1978 (47 years — first private PT practice in Cincinnati)
- **Key People:** Catherine "Katie" Blake PT (Founder, may be semi-retired), Sue DiOrio PT (Group Head/Managing Partner), Christine Maag PT (Group Head/Managing Partner)
- **Email:** info@blakeandassociatespt.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic website. No online scheduling. No patient portal. WorkSteps licensed. Dual branding (old vs new).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 10+ clinicians in single location with no visible scheduling technology
  - Dual brand identity (Blake & Associates vs. BLAKE Physical Therapy & Wellness) — ad-hoc marketing/ops evolution
  - WorkSteps provider = additional compliance/reporting burden
  - Not BBB accredited despite 47 years
  - **"100+ years of integrated experience"** among staff = entrenched legacy processes
  - Practice built in 1978, pre-digital — decades of manual workarounds
- **Why:** The longest-standing independent PT practice in Cincinnati. Large enough team (15-22) to feel real operational pain, no digital tools, dual branding confusion, WorkSteps compliance overhead. Current managing partners inherited legacy systems and would be receptive to streamlining.

##### Cincinnati Occupational Therapy Institute (COTI)
- **Website:** https://www.cintiotinstitute.com/
- **Size:** 30-40 employees, single location, 30+ OTs
- **Founded:** 30+ years (early 1990s)
- **Key People:** Deborah Whitcomb (Owner — business background, not clinical; bought from 4 founding owners after 5 years as consultant/business manager)
- **Email:** info@cintiotinstitute.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Dated website. Paper/PDF intake forms. No online scheduling. No patient portal. Referral-based model.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Paper/PDF intake**: patients must **"complete a client information form and age specific questionnaire and send them in to the office"** before being scheduled
  - No online scheduling for 30+ therapists
  - **Low admin pay ($12-13/hr receptionist/admin)** = high turnover risk in front-desk roles
  - Serves children + adults with complex conditions = heavy documentation + insurance authorization burden
- **Why:** Arguably the ripest prospect in this entire batch. 30-40 employees, paper-based intake, no online scheduling, low-paid admin (turnover risk), 30+ therapists in a single location with minimal technology. Deborah Whitcomb is a business-minded owner who would understand ROI arguments. The gap between clinical excellence (5-star reviews) and operational infrastructure (PDF forms, phone scheduling) is enormous.

#### Priority 2

##### Reactive Physical Therapy
- **Website:** https://www.goreactive.com/
- **Size:** ~10-14 employees, single location
- **Key People:** Doug Rempe PT MEd ATC (President/Founder — US Paralympics Medical Staff)
- **Email:** drempe@goreactive.com (INFERRED)
- **Pain Signals:** No online self-scheduling despite premium positioning. Manual comms ("call text or email anytime"). Dual billing model (cash + insurance).
- **Why:** More tech-aware than others (online intake, emailed evaluations) but unsystematized. Pitch is about scaling efficiency. Lower priority because pain is less acute.

### Urgent Care Centers

#### Priority 1

##### Eastside Urgent Care
- **Website:** https://www.esurgentcare.com/
- **Size:** ~16-26 employees, single location
- **Founded:** 2004 (20+ years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Noor U. Hassan MD (Owner & Medical Director)
- **Email:** info@esurgentcare.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. Solv integration for walk-in queue. Telehealth. Online registration. Pay My Bill portal. Digital X-ray/lab/EKG.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Yelp: **"They advertise a 30 minute wait time or less, but wait times have never been less than 2 HOURS, even when the waiting room has been empty"**
  - **"Unexpected or unclear charges"** and **"difficulties understanding the billing process"**
  - Gap between 30-min marketing promise and 2-hour reality = broken workflow
- **Why:** Owner-operator, 20-year business, clear wait time and billing pain. The gap between their marketing promise and reality screams broken workflow.

##### Tri-State Urgent Care LLC
- **Website:** NONE — zero web presence
- **Size:** 3 locations, est. 15-40 employees
- **Key People:** Ms. Thoraya Hassan (Owner per BBB)
- **Email:** None available (no website, no domain)
- **Tech Stack:** NO WEBSITE. Listed on Solv/Healthgrades/WebMD directories only. No online check-in. No patient portal. Zero digital infrastructure.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **3-location urgent care with ZERO digital presence**
  - Indeed employee rating **2.5/5**
  - Not BBB accredited — "does not have sufficient information to issue a rating"
- **Why:** The definition of "drowning in manual processes." 3 locations, no website, no online scheduling, no patient portal. Requires phone outreach to reach — no email or website.

##### Bluegrass Urgent Care
- **Website:** https://bluegrassurgentcare.com/
- **Size:** 4-5 physicians + ~19 total staff, 4 NKY locations
- **Key People:** Olivia So (Clinical Director/NP), Dr. Robert So MD (physician, likely owner)
- **Email:** info@bluegrassurgentcare.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic website. E-visits. No online check-in. Not BBB accredited.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **Yelp 1.2 stars** (!)
  - **"I was there for over 2 hours waiting to be seen, only to find out the doctor had not even arrived at the office yet"**
  - **"Staff were reportedly holding steroids until a $210 payment was made"** for patient in respiratory distress
  - **"Constant employee turnover"**
  - **"Incorrect billing"**
  - **"Online said no wait but waited for almost 2 hours with only 1 person ahead"** — online system inaccuracy
- **Why:** 4-location practice in operational crisis: 1.2 Yelp stars, constant turnover, billing-before-care incidents, wildly inaccurate wait reporting. Desperately needs process overhaul — but may be a difficult client.

#### Priority 2

##### Florence Urgent Care
- **Website:** https://www.florenceurgentcare.com/
- **Size:** 4 physicians + ~10-20 staff, single location
- **Founded:** 1999 (25+ years)
- **Pain Signals:** Front-desk process issues, website/services mismatch ("lists flu under services but don't do flu swabs"), BBB B- (failure to respond to complaint). Owner identity unclear.
- **Why:** 25-year practice with moderate pain. Owner identity unclear makes outreach harder.

### Behavioral Health / Mental Health

#### Priority 1

##### Viewpoint Psychological Services PLLC
- **Website:** https://www.viewpointpsych.com/
- **Size:** 25+ therapists + 30-40 total staff, 4 NKY locations
- **Founded:** 2006 (20 years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Jennifer Ossege PsyD (Co-Founder/Owner, also Xavier adjunct), Ted Ossege LCSW (Co-Founder/Owner — oversees daily operations = the buyer)
- **Email:** info@viewpointpsych.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Weebly website. Client portal (EHR link). Telehealth via PSYPACT. No online self-scheduling.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Active hiring for clinical roles = growth pressure or turnover
  - 4 locations = significant coordination complexity
  - Phone-based scheduling across all locations (no online booking)
- **Why:** Perfect size (30-40 staff, 4 locations). Ted Ossege runs daily operations — he's the direct buyer. Multi-location phone scheduling is the bottleneck.

##### Cincinnati & Commonwealth Counseling Service Inc.
- **Website:** https://cincinnaticounseling.org/
- **Size:** 25+ therapists + 30-40 total staff, multi-location
- **Founded:** 1972 (50+ years)
- **Key People:** Leadership not publicly listed — must call to identify
- **Email:** info@cincinnaticounseling.org (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic WordPress. No online scheduling. No digital cancellations. Phone-only everything.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **"All Appointments Scheduled at Western Hills"** — centralized phone scheduling at one location for multi-site practice
  - Explicitly: **"We don't take cancellations through email or contact form"** — remarkable anti-digital policy
  - Complex payer mix (Medicaid/Medicare/TRICARE/private/sliding scale) = billing complexity
  - 50+ year organization with legacy processes
- **Why:** The explicit refusal to accept digital cancellations is one of the most striking pain signals in the entire prospect database. A 50-year-old, multi-location practice where ALL scheduling and cancellations go through a single phone number at one location. This is a practice that has never been shown a better way.

#### Priority 2

##### Inclusive Counseling
- **Website:** https://www.inclusivecounseling.net/
- **Size:** 8-15 clinicians (independent contractors) + admin, 3 locations
- **Founded:** ~2020-2021
- **Key People:** Alexandria "Alyx" Fields LISW-S (Practice Owner)
- **Email:** info@inclusivecounseling.net (CONFIRMED)
- **Tech Stack:** Squarespace. SimplePractice EHR (confirmed). TherapyDen + Psychology Today.
- **Pain Signals:** Decentralized scheduling ("Each therapist manages their own schedules"). Contractor model = no centralized authority. Manual billing reconciliation.
- **Why:** Good prospect with accessible owner and confirmed email, but smaller end of range and contractor model may limit budget + ops control. SimplePractice already in place = some tech adoption.

### Optometry

#### Priority 1

##### Madeira Optical
- **Website:** https://www.madeiraoptical.com/
- **Size:** 3 ODs + ~20 total staff, single location with optical dispensary
- **Founded:** 1956 (70 years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Malinda Pence OD (Owner, took over 2002), Teresa Dixon (General Manager — the ops buyer), Dr. Anna Hopkins Reese OD, Dr. Christie Francia OD (joined Jan 2026)
- **Email:** info@madeiraoptical.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Online scheduling. Patient portal (Rx access). Digital retinal imaging. Eye Light tech.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Yelp: **"They are so NOT up front with costs — not a single mention was made in my 1.5 hour visit. Finally, after sitting 15 minutes watching the woman tallying up costs, I finally had to ASK what anything cost."**
  - Just absorbed Eyecare on the Square patients (competitor closed) = sudden growth pressure
- **Why:** 70-year legacy practice that just absorbed a competitor's patient base — ideal timing. Teresa Dixon (GM) is the ops buyer. Billing transparency complaint signals front-desk process gaps. Growth pressure creates urgency.

##### Ritter-Hagee Doctors of Optometry
- **Website:** https://ritterhagee.com/
- **Size:** 6-7 ODs + ~20-35 total staff, 2 locations (Blue Ash + Maineville)
- **Founded:** ~1986-1988 (nearly 40 years, 2nd generation family)
- **Key People:** Dr. Matthew T. Ritter OD (likely managing partner, 2nd gen), Dr. Mark Hagee OD (co-founder), Dr. Brennen Ritter Yaquinto OD (2nd gen)
- **Email:** frontoffice@ritterhagee.com (CONFIRMED — scheduling/billing), optical@ritterhagee.com (CONFIRMED — orders)
- **Tech Stack:** Older/template website. Appointment request form (not self-scheduling). No patient portal. Separate emails for front office vs. optical = siloed workflows.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB B- with failure to respond to 1 complaint
  - Reviewer: **"know your insurance benefits in advance"** = practice doesn't proactively help patients understand coverage
  - Split email addresses (frontoffice@ vs. optical@) = siloed workflows
  - 2 locations with separate workflows but presumably shared systems
- **Why:** Two-location family practice with siloed workflows (separate emails for front office vs. optical). Multi-location coordination pain. BBB complaint non-response signals overwhelmed back office. 2nd-generation transition may open receptivity to modernizing.

#### Priority 2

##### Oakley Square Eye Associates
- **Website:** https://www.oakleyeye.com/
- **Size:** 8 ODs + ~15-30 total staff, single location
- **Founded:** 1988 (37+ years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Phillip E. Apfel OD (President/Owner), Dr. Anthony Dirr OD (Partner)
- **Pain Signals:** Wait times, insurance verification confusion, **"Glasses arrived that were never the frames chosen nor the correct prescription"** — optical order management failure. 8 ODs in single location = scheduling complexity.
- **Why:** Strong pain signals in order fulfillment and insurance verification. 8 doctors in one location is complex. May have more operational infrastructure already given size.

### Disqualified — Batch 8

**PT/OT:**
- **Drayer Physical Therapy** — Upstream Rehabilitation / US Physical Therapy subsidiary
- **BenchMark Physical Therapy** — Upstream Rehabilitation subsidiary

- **MyEyeDr** — PE-backed corporate chain
- **Visionworks** — VSP corporate

## MEDICAL/DENTAL — BATCH 9 EXPANSION: Dental, Chiropractic, Pharmacy, Podiatry

**Added 2026-02-12 | +12 new prospects | Running total: 254/500**

### Dental Practices

#### Priority 1

##### Bell Dental Group
- **Website:** https://belldentalgroup.com/
- **Size:** 5 dentists + 11-50 total staff, single location (Hyde Park)
- **Founded:** 1983 (42 years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Charles "Chuck" Bell DDS (President/Co-Owner), Dr. David Bell Jr. DDS (VP/Co-Owner — twin brothers), Dr. Maggie Ernst, Dr. Joyce Crowe, Dr. Elizabeth Huck
- **Email:** Pattern likely first@belldentalgroup.com (LeadIQ) — Confidence: LOW
- **Tech Stack:** Modern website. No online scheduling. No patient portal. CareCredit.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed employee: **"A lot of work for front desk"** and **"patients are not always happy, which makes work difficult"**
  - RateABiz patient: **"I was told I needed a lot of old fillings redone... After having half the work done and maxing out my insurance with a $300+ bill... my old dentist said my teeth looked good"** — trust/billing issue
  - $25 broken appointment fee + 1.5% monthly interest on unpaid balances = manual A/R follow-up
- **Why:** 5-dentist independent practice, front desk overload confirmed by employee, no online scheduling. Hyde Park = affluent, high volume. Twin brothers as co-owners = accessible decision-makers.

##### Eastgate Dental Excellence
- **Website:** https://eastgatedentalexcellence.com/
- **Size:** 3 dentists + 15-25 total staff, single location
- **Founded:** 1982 (43 years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Daniel Kelley DDS (Co-Owner), Dr. Jodie Yildirim DDS (Co-Owner), Dr. Alessandra Mayo DDS, Ashlee (Financial Coordinator since 2019)
- **Tech Stack:** Professional website. No online self-scheduling. CareCredit.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **"Handling multiple insurance claims is frustrating"**
  - **"Scheduling process challenging during peak times, especially around holidays when emergencies arise"**
  - Dedicated financial coordinator = significant billing/payment plan workload
  - 652+ reviews = high patient volume
- **Why:** Insurance billing complexity explicitly called out in reviews. Dedicated financial coordinator role signals manual billing workload. High review volume. Co-owners likely want to focus on dentistry.

#### Priority 2

##### Conover Family Dental
- **Website:** https://conoverfamilydental.com/
- **Size:** 2 dentists + 12-20 total staff, 2 locations (Mt. Airy + Deer Park)
- **Founded:** 1980 (45 years, multi-generational)
- **Key People:** Dr. Jonathan Conover DDS (Owner, took over from father David), Dr. Cherie Senger DDS, Amy Mullis (Office Manager — LinkedIn confirmed)
- **Pain Signals:** Patient sent away without antibiotics or payment plan for abscess. 2 locations with 2 dentists. Complex services (IV sedation, aligners, TMJ, sleep apnea). In-house membership plan adds billing layer.
- **Why:** Multi-location, multi-generational with identified Office Manager (Amy Mullis). Payment process failure and generational transition create openings.

### Chiropractic

#### Priority 1

##### Mt. Lookout Chiropractic & Sports Injury Center
- **Website:** https://mtlookoutchiro.com/
- **Size:** 10 DCs + 2 PTs + 20-30 total staff, single location
- **Founded:** 1986/1987 (35+ years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Mark A. King DC (Co-Founder/President, also President of Motion Palpation Institute), Dr. Donna L. Moloney DC (Co-Founder), Dr. Eric Eiselt (since 1996), Dr. Steve King (since 1997)
- **Email:** info@mtlookoutchiro.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress. ChiroTouch EHR with online chiro scheduling. PT appointments phone-only. No ATS.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - PT scheduling still phone-only despite ChiroTouch for chiro appointments — split system
  - Indeed: **"PT Aide/Tech/Administration Assistant"** multi-role posting = staff wearing many hats
  - Patient left before being seen due to wait time
  - 12 providers in single location with 1,321+ Birdeye reviews = massive volume
- **Why:** Largest independent chiropractic group in Cincinnati. 12 providers in one location with split scheduling systems (ChiroTouch for chiro, phone for PT). Multi-role job postings signal operational strain.

#### Priority 2

##### Fick Chiropractic Centers
- **Website:** https://www.fickchiropractic.com/
- **Size:** 3 DCs + 8-15 total staff, multi-location
- **Founded:** 1986 (40 years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Randall Fick DC DABCO (Founder, 42 years experience)
- **Pain Signals:** Zero online scheduling across multiple locations. One location closed. Low review volume despite 40 years.
- **Why:** Multi-location with no digital tools. Phone-only booking. Lower certainty on pain level.

##### All Star Chiropractic & Rehabilitation
- **Website:** https://allstar-chiropractic.com/
- **Size:** 3-4 DCs + 8-15 total staff, single location (Florence KY)
- **Key People:** Dr. Robert "Bob" Coppola Jr. DC (Founder/Owner)
- **Email:** drbob@allstar-chiropractic.com (CONFIRMED)
- **Pain Signals:** Broad service mix (7+ service types) with 3-4 providers. Groupon presence = volume pressure.
- **Why:** Confirmed email, accessible owner. More tech-aware (Demandforce) but complexity to optimize. NKY.

### Independent Pharmacies

#### Priority 1

##### Tri-State Compounding Pharmacy & Kunkel Medical
- **Website:** https://tristaterx.com/
- **Size:** 10-25 employees, single location (compounding + DME)
- **Founded:** Originally 1939 as Kunkel Apothecary; current ownership since 2014
- **Key People:** Chad Thompson RPh PharmD MBA JD (Owner since 2014 — pharmacist with MBA AND law degree), John Dinkelaker (Co-owner/prior owner)
- **Email:** info@tristaterx.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Wix-style website. No online refill portal. No delivery logistics platform.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB C+ — **"failed to respond to 1 complaint"**
  - Birdeye: **"Staff not being as considerate and responsive as other pharmacies"**
  - BBB complaint about DME return process
  - Dual business (compounding + DME) = operational complexity across two verticals
- **Why:** Owner has PharmD + MBA + JD — extremely business-minded, will understand ROI immediately. Dual business creates process complexity. BBB non-response = overwhelmed ops.

##### Bernens Convalescent Pharmacy
- **Website:** https://www.bernens.com/
- **Size:** 11-50 employees, single location
- **Founded:** 1938 (87 years!)
- **Key People:** Mary C. Engelhardt (President), Holly Engelhardt RPh (staff since age 16, UC 1995), Kate Engelhardt Kuhlmann PharmD (OSU/UC 2005), Ann Engelhardt (Director Clinical Services)
- **Email:** bernens@fuse.net (CONFIRMED — on contact page)
- **Tech Stack:** **Hand-coded HTML website** (!). **@fuse.net ISP email** (!). Fax: (513) 471-1443. No online refills. No e-commerce. Drive-up window. Delivery service.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - **@fuse.net consumer ISP email** as primary business contact for 87-year-old company
  - Hand-coded HTML website with no CMS
  - No online refills, no patient portal
  - BBB complaint about DME rental pricing confusion
  - Not BBB accredited
  - Multi-department: pharmacy + compounding + DME + delivery + clinical services with in-house RN
- **Why:** Bernens may be the most technologically frozen prospect in the entire database. An 87-year-old, multi-generational Engelhardt family business using hand-coded HTML and @fuse.net email to run a pharmacy + DME + delivery + clinical services operation with 11-50 employees. Expanded into DME in 1963 and apparently hasn't updated systems since. The @fuse.net email puts them alongside Floors by Valvano and Ford & Son Roofing in the tech-lag hall of fame.

#### Priority 2

##### Harrison Pharmacy & Wellness
- **Website:** https://harrisonwellness.com/
- **Size:** 5-15 employees, single location
- **Key People:** Caroline Allen (Owner)
- **Pain Signals:** Yelp 2.5 stars. Heroic individual efforts compensating for systems. Multi-state licensing adds compliance.
- **Why:** More tech-forward (Shopify, RxLocal) than other pharmacy prospects. Lower priority. At lower end of size range.

### Podiatry

#### Priority 1

##### Family Foot & Ankle Center
- **Website:** https://www.yourfamilyfootcare.com/
- **Size:** 3-5 DPMs + 20-40 total staff, 6 locations
- **Founded:** 2004
- **Key People:** Dr. Cynthia Miller DPM (Founder/Owner), Dr. Kelly Heppert DPM (Associate)
- **Email:** info@yourfamilyfootcare.com (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Dated ColdFusion website (.cfm pages!). Online appointment request form. No patient portal.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Yelp: **"Waited 1 hour and 7 minutes past my appointment time"**
  - **"Office was supposed to call to schedule MRI and call after receiving results but never did"**
  - **"After requesting medical records multiple times... still hadn't received them"**
  - Indeed: **"No on-site managers to help and different policies across the four different offices"**
  - **"Management cursing at employees"**
  - Yelp 3.1/5. Not BBB accredited.
- **Why:** Operational chaos across 6 locations with inconsistent policies, no on-site management, broken patient communication, long waits, and toxic Indeed reviews. ColdFusion website (.cfm pages) is a remarkable tech artifact. Founder is clearly stretched thin.

#### Priority 2

##### Choice Podiatry Associates
- **Website:** https://www.choicepodiatry.com/
- **Size:** 3 DPMs + 10-18 total staff, 2-3 locations
- **Founded:** 1997 (29 years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Jay T. Feist DPM (President), Dr. John M. Rootring DPM, Dr. Ben Haberer DPM
- **Pain Signals:** No online scheduling or patient portal. Insurance mix-up. Basic/dated website. Small digital footprint.
- **Why:** Long-established, right-sized, phone-only operations. Modernization play.

##### Podiatry Associates of Cincinnati
- **Website:** https://www.cincypodiatryoh.com/
- **Size:** 7 DPMs + 25-45 total staff, 4 locations
- **Founded:** 1975 (51 years)
- **Key People:** Dr. Nicholas Woebkenberg DPM (Xavier MBA — business-minded)
- **Pain Signals:** Reception unprofessionalism complaints. No patient portal or online scheduling for 7 doctors across 4 locations. 51 years of legacy processes.
- **Why:** Largest qualified prospect. Dr. Woebkenberg's MBA makes him a potential champion. Approach with growth/optimization framing rather than crisis messaging.

### Disqualified — Batch 9

**Dental:**
- **Heritage Dental Center** — DSO-owned (Heritage Dental Group LP)
- **Cincinnati Dental Services** — Likely DSO/corporate-affiliated (43-office DSO)
- **Aspen Dental** — National DSO
- **Cordental Group** — DSO (Blue Ash HQ, 40+ locations, 9 states)

**Chiropractic:**
- **The Joint Chiropractic** — Franchise
- **HealthSource Chiropractic** — Franchise

**Pharmacy:**
- **CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Walmart** — Chain pharmacies
- **TriHealth Pharmacy Solutions** — Health system-owned
- **Hill's Compounding Pharmacy** — Likely too small (<5 employees)

**Podiatry:**
- **Cincinnati Foot & Ankle Care (CFAC)** — Too large (11-18 locations, 80-120+ employees)
- **Beyond Podiatry** — National chain (35+ locations)
- **Foot & Ankle Specialists** — PE-owned (NMS Capital roll-up)
- **Ohio Foot & Ankle Specialists** — Too large (35+ locations)

# SUPPLIERS — EXPANDED (Batches 10-11)

**Added 2026-02-12 | +18 new prospects | Running total: 272/500**

## Industry Context — New Sub-segments

The original Suppliers vertical focused on plumbing/HVAC, janitorial, industrial, and building material distributors. Batches 10-11 expand into four new sub-segments: **auto parts & recycling**, **food service supply**, **safety/PPE & packaging**, and **electrical/HVAC distribution**.

**Auto parts recyclers** are operationally fascinating — managing acres of vehicles with hundreds of thousands of SKUs, often with no digital inventory system. The industry is consolidating (LKQ, KOI, Smyth/Fisher), but Cincinnati has a cluster of multi-generational independents still running on phone orders, paper tickets, and eBay side hustles.

**Food service suppliers** face brutal competition from Sysco, US Foods, and Gordon Food Service. Independents survive on relationships and niche specialization (ethnic markets, institutional, used equipment), but their back offices often run on "very old software" or no software at all. Employee turnover is a reliable pain signal — warehouse and delivery work is physically demanding, and companies that underpay or mismanage see it in their Indeed reviews.

**Safety/PPE distributors** are a hidden gem. Companies like First Star Safety serve government contracts (MBE/SBE certified) that require operational rigor they may not yet have. Packaging distributors managing multi-warehouse operations face classic inventory coordination challenges.

**Electrical/HVAC distribution** is heavily consolidated nationally (Graybar, CES, Wesco, Rexel), but Cincinnati still has family-owned independents. The strongest signal: in 2026, a wholesale distributor with no e-commerce is losing business daily. Several prospects here are 50-90 years old and still phone-order-only.

## Priority 1

### Stricker Auto Parts
- **Website:** https://strickerautoparts.com/
- **Size:** ~36 employees, 68-acre facility, 185K sq ft warehouse, 300K+ SKUs
- **Founded:** 1955 (71 years). Family-owned, three generations (Stricker family).
- **Key People:** Arthur Stricker (President), John Stricker (owner/operator), Cathy Stricker (co-owner)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic WordPress site. No online ordering (sells on eBay as side channel). Cash/check only — no credit card processing. No visible ERP or inventory system.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Does NOT accept credit cards or returns: *"They don't accept returns or credit cards."* (Yelp/Birdeye)
  - Parts quality disputes: *"Paid $2,100 for a lift gate assembly described as in excellent condition, but a wiring harness, two object sensors were damaged, and interior panels were missing."* (Birdeye)
  - Inconsistent service: *"Drove much farther to avoid dealing with [specific staff member]"* (Google) — process depends on which person you get
  - Indeed wages $12.55-$15.49/hr — retention pressure
- **Why:** A 36-person operation managing 300K+ SKUs across 68 acres with no credit card processing, no online ordering, and no returns policy is almost certainly running on paper and tribal knowledge. The no-credit-card policy alone is a red flag for back-office modernization needs.

### Carthage Auto Parts
- **Website:** https://www.carthageautoparts.com/ (also https://www.carthageautopartsoh.com/ — two competing sites)
- **Size:** ~10-20 employees, 24-acre facility
- **Founded:** 1954 (72 years). BBB Accredited since 9/2024.
- **Key People:** William Hall (Owner), Kevin Hill (Inventory Manager), Billy Hall (family)
- **Tech Stack:** Two competing websites (GoDaddy builder + newer site). No online ordering or inventory lookup. Phone-based ordering.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB pricing bait-and-switch: *"Quoted a price over the phone but had the price raised when they showed up for a part that was not in good condition."*
  - Pre-payment/fulfillment breakdown: *"Purchased a 'low mileage' used engine, was required to pay the full amount before it was ready (rather than just a deposit), and after payment received poor service and claims to have been lied to multiple times."*
  - Communication and delay complaints across multiple platforms
  - 3.9/5 with 262 reviews — notably lower than competitors
- **Why:** Pricing disputes, prepayment problems, and communication breakdowns point to a lack of standardized quoting, order tracking, and customer communication tools. The two-competing-websites situation confirms there's no coherent digital strategy.

### Miamitown Auto Parts & Recycling
- **Website:** https://www.miamitownautoparts.com/
- **Size:** ~8-15 employees, 2 locations
- **Founded:** 1969 (57 years). Family-owned, second-generation ownership since 2017 after founder's death in 2016.
- **Key People:** Marlo Schaible (Partner/Owner, daughter of founder), Ralph Rocco (Partner), Jimmy Schaffer (Owner/Manager), Jeff Schaffer (Partner)
- **Tech Stack:** Template website. No online inventory or ordering. Two locations with no unified system. Scrap pricing is phone-based.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 2017 ownership transition after founder's death — new leadership often means appetite for modernization
  - "Occasional communication issues" in reviews
  - Dual business model (auto parts + scrap metal recycling) adds coordination complexity across two locations
  - 3.7 stars with limited reviews
- **Why:** A 57-year-old business that just went through a generational ownership change is in a prime modernization window. Running two locations with dual revenue streams without visible digital tools means the new owners are juggling spreadsheets across sites. Generational transitions are the single best buying window.

### Atlantic Foods Corporation
- **Website:** https://atlanticfoods.com/
- **Size:** ~20-65 employees, 65K sq ft facility
- **Founded:** 1961 (65 years). Family-owned, two generations (Grefer/Goret families).
- **Key People:** Gary Grefer (CEO/President), Brian Goret (President/HR Director), Stuart Goret (VP), Daniel Grefer (Account Executive), Kyle Grefer (Manager, Purchasing)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress + WooCommerce on IIS/PHP. Mobile app for catalog browsing/ordering. But "very old software" per employee reviews — legacy ERP/warehouse system underneath.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed 2.6/5 (9 reviews): *"Managers don't know what are doing, changing pay scale every 6 months"*
  - *"Use of very old software"* — employee directly calling out tech debt
  - *"Very unorganized with very little reward"*
  - *"No pay advancements and no way to move up in the company at all"*
  - *"Pay depends on who you know and if the supervisor likes you, definitely not on work ethic"*
  - Active job postings suggest ongoing turnover
- **Why:** Classic mid-size family distributor with documented operational chaos. An employee literally said "very old software." Five family members in leadership positions managing a 65K sq ft operation with high turnover and disorganized management. The mobile app shows aspiration but the back-end is broken.

### Dine Company — The Restaurant Store
- **Website:** https://www.dinecompany.com/
- **Size:** ~30 employees, 45K sq ft retail showroom, 1 location
- **Founded:** 1982 (44 years). Family-owned and operated.
- **Key People:** Evan Manias (President/VP Operations, family successor)
- **Tech Stack:** Website with online shopping and custom web portals. Domain email. Markets as "high tech, high touch" but internal systems failing.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed 2.3/5 Louisville: *"Male chauvinist attitudes and persona"*
  - *"Run by two managers — one is the owner's son who acts very entitled and lacks managerial skills, while the other manager appears emotionally detached"*
  - CEO Evan Manias approval rating: **1%** from employees on Indeed
  - Strong customer reviews (4.4/5, 236 reviews) vs. terrible employee satisfaction — the outside works, the inside is breaking
- **Why:** The gap between strong customer satisfaction and terrible employee satisfaction is textbook "outgrowing management systems." A 30-employee, 44-year family business with 1% CEO approval is a company where the processes around the people have failed. Louisville HQ but actively serves Cincinnati.

### First Star Safety
- **Website:** https://www.firststarsafety.com/
- **Size:** ~31 employees
- **Founded:** 2006 (20 years).
- **Key People:** Kelly Hollatz (President & Founder), Lindsey Redwine (HR Director), Amy Taylor (Sales Ops Support Specialist), Carl Lengerich (Will Call Sales Coordinator)
- **Tech Stack:** Squarespace/Wix-style website. No e-commerce or online ordering. Custom domain email. No visible ERP or inventory system.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: *"Snapped at or yelled at daily"* after first month, witnessed *"a manager yelling at other employees"* — company responded that person is no longer there
  - Actively hiring warehouse associates ($15-18/hr) and construction warehouse laborers ($17-22/hr) — turnover or growth strain
  - Glassdoor: *"It was a rough start, but things have turned around dramatically"*
  - BBB not accredited
- **Why:** At 31 employees with active hiring, First Star is in the growth zone where manual processes break. MBE/SBE certified = pursues government contracts requiring operational rigor they may not yet have. Past management complaints suggest systems are needed to replace personality-dependent management.

### AM Shipping Supplies
- **Website:** https://www.amshippingsupplies.com/
- **Size:** ~11-50 employees, ~$5M revenue, 6 warehouse locations
- **Founded:** 1984 (42 years). Family-owned.
- **Key People:** Andrew "Andy" Moder (Owner), Greg Waller (Sales)
- **Tech Stack:** Modern website with product catalog and online ordering. Custom domain email. Multi-warehouse coordination likely straining current systems.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Customer: *"Wish that shipping costs were lower"* and *"occasional limitations in stock variety or product availability"* — inventory management across 6 warehouses
  - 4.9 stars 131 reviews — operationally solid but growth creates complexity
  - Not BBB accredited despite 42 years
  - Cincinnati HQ with warehouses in Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, PA, CA — massive coordination overhead
- **Why:** Family-owned 42-year packaging distributor managing 6 warehouse locations is right in the operational complexity sweet spot. Multi-location inventory coordination, order routing, and maintaining service quality at scale are exactly the problems that need systems.

### SHIP-PAQ Inc
- **Website:** https://www.ship-paq.com/
- **Size:** ~16 employees, 93.5K sq ft facility, ~$6M revenue
- **Founded:** 1987 (39 years). Family-owned (Jarboe family).
- **Key People:** Randy Jarboe (President), Kyle Jarboe (VP), Nancy Jarboe (Administrative Director)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress-based website. In-house custom printing capabilities. Product info but unclear if true e-commerce. Custom domain email likely.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor: *"The salary is too low, plus they don't really incentivize the sales force at all"*
  - *"Owner has a major ego complex, always looks down on you!"*
  - *"They claim they pay for your gas but they put it in with the 'salary' and it gets taxed"* — suggests informal/manual HR and payroll
  - *"Stuck in the cave"* — morale issue
  - Doubled facility in 2018 (46.5K to 93.5K sq ft) but likely didn't double systems
- **Why:** Doubled their facility without doubling their ops infrastructure. Glassdoor reveals growing pains — low pay, poor incentive structure, informal HR. A family business with $6M revenue and in-house printing managing a 93.5K sq ft operation has significant operational complexity outpacing their systems.

### 2J Supply Company
- **Website:** https://www.2jsupply.com/
- **Size:** ~55 employees, 11 locations (OH, KY, IN, WV)
- **Founded:** 1962 (63 years). 3rd-generation family-owned (Trimbach family).
- **Key People:** Jason Trimbach (CEO, 3rd gen), Kevin Trimbach (President/COO, 3rd gen)
- **Tech Stack:** Custom website with online catalog and contractor login. "2J University" training platform for contractors. Google Analytics. Active social media. Some tech investment but management systems failing.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor 3.8/5 (30 reviews, only 66% recommend): *"The company is going by way of too much micro management"* with *"high turnover in all job functions"* and *"poisoned culture"*
  - *"No integrity amongst employees and management, no principles or morals"*
  - *"Benefits are horrible and PTO is lacking and confusing in process"*
  - Indeed: *"Too many people in charge who lack knowledge"*
  - *"They don't promote from inside the company"*
  - BBB: Cincinnati location NOT accredited
- **Why:** Classic 3rd-generation distributor growing faster than its management systems. "Too much micromanagement" + "high turnover" + "poisoned culture" = owners trying to maintain control manually instead of through systems. 11 locations to coordinate with "too many people in charge who lack knowledge" is a textbook ops failure. The 3rd-gen transition is a prime buying window.

### Winstel Controls
- **Website:** https://www.winstelcontrols.com/ (marketing) + https://winstelcontrolsonline.com/ (e-commerce/legacy)
- **Size:** ~20-49 employees, 2 locations (Cincinnati + Hamilton)
- **Founded:** 1934 (91 years). Current ownership since 1999.
- **Key People:** Daniel Jurkowitz (President/Owner), Mike Jurkowitz (VP), Danny Jurkowitz Jr. (CTO — owner's son)
- **Tech Stack:** Two separate websites — one with legacy .php pages. E-commerce with AfterShip integration. Constant Contact email marketing. Google Analytics. CTO (owner's son) building internally.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Two-website problem: winstelcontrols.com AND winstelcontrolsonline.com with .php pages — fragmented tech, likely a stalled migration
  - Grew from 3 employees in 1999 to 40+ today — growth without proportional systems investment
  - Acquired Barry Company in Hamilton 2006 — acquisition integration complexity
  - Generally positive employee reviews (4.5/5 Indeed) — well-run but needs systems
- **Why:** A well-run company that knows it needs better systems but hasn't gotten there yet. The two-website situation and .php legacy catalog are symptoms of a stalled tech transition. The CTO son (Danny Jr.) makes them receptive to technology conversations. This is a "Reluctant Operator" who grew from 3 to 40+ employees and knows manual processes won't scale further.

### A&S Electric Supply
- **Website:** https://www.a-s-electric.com/
- **Size:** ~16-20 employees, 1 location with lighting showroom
- **Founded:** 1969 (56 years). Family-owned, 2nd generation (Smith family).
- **Key People:** Tom Smith (President/Owner, son of co-founder), Evan Smith (Warehouse Manager), Kim Bessler (Secretary)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic template website. No online ordering. No visible ERP. Generic email inbox (inquire@a-s-electric.com). BBB A+ accredited since 2005.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - No e-commerce in 2026 for a wholesale electrical distributor = significant competitive gap vs. Graybar, CES, Becker
  - Recent 2024 office move = process disruption and natural modernization trigger
  - Very few Yelp reviews for 56-year company — minimal digital presence
  - Generic email inbox instead of individual addresses
  - Family-run with tribal knowledge (owner's son manages warehouse)
- **Why:** The most "analog" electrical distributor in the research. In 2026, a wholesale distributor with no online ordering is losing business to competitors who offer it. The recent office move creates a natural "while we're changing everything anyway" modernization window. Tom Smith is the decision-maker; Evan Smith in the warehouse sees the daily pain.

## Priority 2

### Allgeier Auto Parts
- **Website:** https://allgeierautoparts.com/ (HTTP only — no SSL)
- **Size:** ~7 employees
- **Founded:** 1999 (27 years). Family-owned.
- **Key People:** Mike Allgeier (Owner), Mark Courter (Counter Manager)
- **Tech Stack:** HTTP-only website (no SSL certificate). Uses Car-Part.com ecosystem (has branded Android app). Basic template site. Member of ARA.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 25% restocking fee on returns (Yelp)
  - *"Rude staff and incorrect parts being pulled"* (Yelp/Google)
  - HTTP-only website in 2026 — extremely dated infrastructure
  - 4.0 stars with recurring quality complaints
- **Why:** 7-person shop with an HTTP website, wrong parts being pulled, and a punitive return policy. Small but very high pain density. Classic owner-does-everything operation.

### Lindale Auto Parts
- **Website:** https://lindaleautoparts.com/
- **Size:** ~4-6 employees, 16 acres, 2,250 sq ft warehouse
- **Founded:** ~1982 (40+ years). Family-owned.
- **Key People:** Richard "Rick" Pardini (President/Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic builder website. No online inventory search. No e-commerce. Phone/walk-in only. Member of ARA.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 2,250 sq ft warehouse managing 16 acres of vehicles — inventory tracking challenge
  - No online parts lookup or ordering
  - Single-owner dependency (Rick IS the business)
  - Sparse reviews
- **Why:** Rick Pardini manages 16 acres of vehicles from a 2,250 sq ft warehouse with no digital inventory system. Classic "everything is in the owner's head" operation.

### Cincinnati Restaurant Equipment Resource
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatirestaurantequipmentresource.com/
- **Size:** ~2-5 employees
- **Founded:** ~2005 (21 years).
- **Key People:** Rick (last name unknown, Owner), Josh (sales/showroom staff)
- **Tech Stack:** Wix website (migrated from WordPress). No e-commerce. No CRM or inventory system visible.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Not BBB accredited
  - Migrated WordPress to Wix — DIY tech approach with platform migrations
  - No online ordering for a RATIONAL combi-oven dealer (high-end equipment that warrants proper quoting tools)
  - Sparse reviews
- **Why:** Owner-operated showroom with Wix website, no e-commerce, and no listed email. Deals in high-end commercial kitchen equipment (RATIONAL dealer) but has zero digital sales infrastructure. Small but high pain.

### Cincinnati Glove & Safety
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatiglove.com/
- **Size:** ~4-10 employees
- **Founded:** 1984 (42 years). Family-owned.
- **Key People:** Mike Hugenberg (Owner), Drew Hugenberg (President/Sales Manager — son)
- **Tech Stack:** Wix website. No online ordering. No visible tech tools.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 42-year family business with under 10 employees — deeply manual, legacy processes
  - Wix website with no e-commerce
  - Only 7 reviews on Birdeye for 42-year business — minimal digital presence
  - BBB accredited since 2015, no complaints — stable but stagnant
- **Why:** Father-to-son generational transition (Mike to Drew) is the key trigger. A 42-year family business making the handoff is the best time to modernize operations.

### Safety First Incorporated
- **Website:** http://www.safetyfirstsupplies.com/ (HTTP only)
- **Size:** ~5 employees, ~$1.6M revenue
- **Founded:** 1998 (28 years).
- **Key People:** Dan Gehlert (President/Founder)
- **Tech Stack:** Static HTML website. No CMS. No SSL certificate. No e-commerce. Fax number listed prominently. Likely spreadsheets and phone orders.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - HTTP-only, non-SSL, static HTML website in 2026
  - No email publicly listed — phone/fax workflow only
  - Fax number listed prominently on website
  - Zero online reviews for 28-year business — completely invisible digital footprint
- **Why:** Textbook "analog distributor." 28 years in business with a static HTML website, no SSL, fax-based ordering, and zero online reviews. Any operational modernization would be transformative. Engagement scope limited by 5-person size.

### Lebanon Electric Supply / Middletown Electric Supply
- **Website:** https://middletownelectric.com/ (also lebanonelectric.com)
- **Size:** ~15-30 employees, 2 locations
- **Founded:** 1960 (65 years). Family-owned (Carter family).
- **Key People:** Tom Carter (President/Owner), Todd Carter (VP), Raymond Saklawy (Showroom Manager), Khoury Walid (Stock Manager)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic informational website. No online ordering. Dual-brand under one company. Business domain email (@lebanonelectric.com).
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Two-location, dual-brand operation with no e-commerce
  - *"Hometown roots with big-city buying power"* — their own marketing acknowledges the small-vs-scale tension
  - No Indeed/Glassdoor reviews = very small headcount
  - 65 years with minimal digital presence
- **Why:** 65-year family electrical distributor running two store brands across two locations with no digital ordering. The Carter family values relationships, making them receptive to tools that enhance (not replace) personal service.

## Priority 3

### Paper Products Company of Cincinnati
- **Website:** https://www.paperproductscompany.com/
- **Size:** Unknown (estimated small-to-mid). Third-generation family-owned.
- **Founded:** 1932 (94 years).
- **Key People:** TBD — third-generation family ownership confirmed but names not surfaced.
- **Tech Stack:** Website exists but minimal detail accessible. Very low digital presence.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 94-year, 3rd-generation family business with extremely low online visibility
  - No reviews, no complaints — invisible digital footprint
  - Serves bakery, deli, supermarket, food service, catering, manufacturing
- **Why:** Insufficient public data to fully qualify, but a 94-year family packaging supplier with near-zero digital presence warrants direct outreach to confirm size, contacts, and pain. WATCH priority until more data available.

### Disqualified
- **Smyth Auto Parts** — 400+ employees, 26 locations, part of Fisher Auto Parts network
- **KOI Auto Parts** — 60+ stores across OH/KY/IN, ESOP, regional chain scale
- **Bessler's U Pull & Save** — Multiple locations across KY/TN, regional chain
- **LKQ / Keystone Automotive** — NYSE-listed national corporation
- **U-Pull-&-Pay** — National chain
- **Tri-State Enterprises** — Buying group/distributor network, not standalone
- **Sysco / US Foods / Gordon Food Service / Performance Foodservice** — National chains
- **Wasserstrom Company** — Columbus HQ, national footprint, too large
- **C&T Design & Equipment** — 145 employees, 4 continents
- **What Chefs Want / Creation Gardens** — Multi-state, likely exceeds 80 employees
- **Abco Safety** — Acquired by Ritz Safety LLC (national) in July 2021
- **Ritz Safety** — National distributor, 17 locations
- **Cintas** — Fortune 500
- **Airgas** — National chain (Air Liquide subsidiary)
- **Shorr Packaging / Crown Packaging / BGR Packaging** — National/regional chains, too large
- **Becker Electric Supply** — 150+ employees, 8 locations
- **Habegger Corporation** — 650+ employees, 54 locations, 7th largest HVAC distributor in US
- **City Electric Supply** — National chain, 550+ branches
- **Tri-State Electric Supply** — Acquired by WinWholesale, no longer independent
- **Eckart Supply** — 143-200 employees, exceeds size criteria
- **Chrisco Restaurant Design & Supply** — 2-4 employees, below minimum

# PROPERTY MANAGEMENT — EXPANDED (Batch 12)

**Added 2026-02-12 | +11 new prospects | Running total: 283/500**

## Industry Context — HOA, Commercial PM, Student Housing

The original Property Management vertical focused on residential rental PM companies. Batch 12 expands into three sub-segments: **HOA/community association management**, **commercial property management**, and **student housing management**.

**HOA management** in Cincinnati is a consolidation story — Cedar Management Group (200-500 employees) and Towne Properties (500-1,000) dominate, while Elite Management merged into Cedar in Oct 2025. The independents that remain are either legacy firms with 40+ year histories and dated infrastructure, or fast-growing startups scaling across metro areas without standardized processes. The recurring pain signal is **homeowner communication failures** — portal access issues, unreturned calls, missed maintenance for months or years.

**Commercial PM** independents are rarer, as CBRE/JLL/Cushman dominate. The survivors tend to be multi-generational family firms with diverse portfolios (retail + office + medical + industrial) creating operational complexity that outpaces their basic tools. The standout signal: firms managing 1M+ sq ft with no enterprise PM software.

**Student housing** operators face intense seasonal cycles — annual lease-ups, mass move-in/move-out, high maintenance volume — that expose process gaps relentlessly. Small operators near UC, Xavier, and Miami University often run on relationships and spreadsheets.

## Priority 1

### Management Plus Realty Services
- **Website:** https://www.managementplusrealtyservice.com/
- **Size:** ~15 employees. Only Cincinnati-native firm with AAMC designation from Community Associations Institute.
- **Founded:** 1984 (40+ years). Women-owned.
- **Key People:** Kelly Smith (Owner & Community Association Manager)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress website. No confirmed HOA management software. Portal login complaints suggest outdated/broken system.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: *"I have been blown off by Management Plus since I moved into my neighborhood in 2021."*
  - Portal/access: *"I could not log in for two months and could not get in touch with anyone over the phone or through email."* (Nov 2024)
  - Maintenance: *"I notified Management Plus of water leaks I've been having over 2 years ago and they have failed to fix any of the leaks."*
  - Counter-positive: *"worked with Management Plus essentially every week for over 20 years...they consistently strive to do what is best for the communities"*
- **Why:** 40-year firm with clear tech gaps causing communication breakdowns. Portal access failures and phone/email unresponsiveness suggest outdated systems. Women-owned small business is an ideal client profile. The AAMC designation shows professional aspiration that their technology hasn't kept up with.

### Eclipse Community Management
- **Website:** https://eclipsecommunities.com/
- **Size:** 11-50 employees. Serves Dayton, Cincinnati, and Columbus metro areas.
- **Founded:** 2017 (8 years). Fast-growing.
- **Key People:** Christopher A. Vecchi (Managing Partner, MPA/CMCA/AMS/PCAM), Heather (Cincinnati Region Manager, 22 yrs), Pam (Cincinnati, CMCA/AMS), Nate (Dayton/Columbus, 20 yrs)
- **Tech Stack:** Vantaca (confirmed — recently transitioned). WordPress website. Portal at home.eclipsecommunities.com.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Yelp: *"Eclipse will NOT do the job properly. The only repair that they do is to apply a band aid. Eclipse is certainly a joke."*
  - Not BBB accredited despite 8 years
  - Rapid 3-city expansion creating operational strain
- **Why:** Fast-growing company scaling across three metro areas with growing pains. Already invested in best-in-class tech (Vantaca) but likely struggling with process standardization across regions. Ideal for operational playbook development rather than software — they have the tools, they need the processes.

### Innovative Management (Theron Inc)
- **Website:** https://www.myinnovative.com/
- **Size:** 25 employees, $5.5M revenue. Serves Cincinnati, NKY, and Pittsburgh.
- **Founded:** BBB Accredited since 2006 (19+ years).
- **Key People:** Shane Studer (CEO — recent hire, leadership transition signal)
- **Tech Stack:** Vantaca (confirmed — published blog post about transition). WordPress website.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: *"Unethical accounting and poor bookkeeping, including false liens on property"*
  - Foreclosure without notice: homeowner *"had their property scheduled for foreclosure sale without previous notification of account issues"*
  - Management transition: homeowner *"was not notified of a management company transition"* — payments not credited
  - Water shutoff due to unpaid backflow testing fees — board communication breakdown
- **Why:** Recent CEO transition signals appetite for change. Serious BBB complaints around accounting errors, lien mistakes, and foreclosure notification failures point to broken internal processes. They're actively investing in new tech (Vantaca) but still suffering operational failures — the tech alone isn't fixing the process problems.

### The Schueler Group (Henkle Schueler)
- **Website:** https://schuelergroup.com/
- **Size:** ~42 employees. Manages 1M+ sq ft of commercial space (health facilities, retail, office). Properties range 700 to 220,000 sq ft.
- **Founded:** 1935 (90 years).
- **Key People:** Mike Schueler (President & CEO), Robin (CFO), Jeff (Senior Brokerage Agent)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress website. No evidence of Yardi/MRI/AppFolio. PM is one of four divisions — likely under-resourced with basic tools.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor 2.0/5 (3 reviews): *"President favors a 'boy's club' and ignores female directors"* — claims *"employees of German descent and males have better advancement prospects"*
  - *"Limited resources for marketing"* — resource constraints signal broader ops under-investment
  - Named "Fast 55" by Cincinnati Business Courier — growth pressure
- **Why:** A 90-year family company managing 1M+ sq ft with ~42 employees across four divisions. PM is just one division, meaning it's under-resourced. Glassdoor reveals internal culture issues and resource constraints. Growth pressure (Fast 55) without matching operational infrastructure is textbook.

### NAI Bergman
- **Website:** https://bergmancommercial.com/
- **Size:** ~15-30 employees. Portfolio includes shopping centers, retail, office, medical, industrial, 80+ acres undeveloped land.
- **Founded:** ~1960 (65+ years). Four generations. NAI affiliate since 2005.
- **Key People:** Laurence "Larry" Bergman (Principal/CEO/Broker of Record), Steven Adler (VP Property Management & Development), Daniel Feigelson (VP Finance & Administration, Principal/Owner), Thomas Bergman (Real Estate Attorney)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress website. NAI platform for listings. No evidence of enterprise PM software. Family firm likely using basic tools.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Very small review footprint (6 reviews on Birdeye) for a 65-year company — limited digital investment
  - 4-generation family operation — conservative tech adoption likely
  - NAI affiliation shows willingness to modernize brand but not necessarily back-office
- **Why:** Four-generation family firm managing a diverse commercial portfolio. NAI affiliation modernized the brand but the back office likely still runs on institutional knowledge. Diverse property types (shopping centers + office + medical + industrial) create complexity that manual processes struggle with. Steven Adler (VP PM, son-in-law) is the key contact.

### Midwest Properties Corp
- **Website:** https://mw1corp.com/
- **Size:** ~9 employees. 160+ commercial/industrial properties across OH, KY, IN along I-75 corridor.
- **Founded:** 2017 (9 years).
- **Key People:** Jared Wendling (Co-Founder & Managing Partner)
- **Tech Stack:** Modern WordPress website. No PM software evidence. Almost certainly using basic tools or spreadsheets at this scale.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 2017 startup to "one of Cincinnati's largest privately-held real estate firms" with 160+ properties and only 9 employees
  - Extremely lean property-to-employee ratio = guaranteed operational bottlenecks
  - No Glassdoor/Indeed/BBB — too small for public reviews
  - I-75 corridor geographic spread adds logistical complexity
- **Why:** 9 people managing 160+ industrial properties is an extreme ratio that practically guarantees operational bottlenecks. Young founders (2017) would be open to technology solutions. The fastest-growing company in this batch — growth is outpacing their ability to manage manually.

### Hillcrest Property Management
- **Website:** https://hillcrestpropertymanagementnky.com/
- **Size:** ~5-10 employees. Managed hundreds of homes over 33 years. NKY focus (Kenton, Boone, Campbell counties).
- **Founded:** 1987 PM experience; LLC established 2012. Parent: Hillcrest Homes Inc since 1996.
- **Key People:** Michael Denigan Sr (Owner/Founder), Josh Denigan (VP — father-son operation)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic WordPress website. Gmail for business email (!). No PM software evidence.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Uses **deniganproperties@gmail.com** as business email — strongest low-tech signal possible
  - Birdeye 4.2/5 (47 reviews): *"The property manager is hard to reach and they don't always return phone calls/emails"*
  - Eviction process gaps — complaint about eviction filing for non-payment + water leak damage
  - "Landlord Liberator" branding = has a method but not the tools to back it up
- **Why:** Father-son NKY operation using Gmail as business email and getting "hard to reach" complaints. They brand themselves as "Landlord Liberators" but can't consistently deliver on that promise without better systems. Gmail for a 33-year PM operation is the strongest possible signal of tech debt.

## Priority 2

### Vertex Professional Group
- **Website:** https://vertexpg.com/
- **Size:** Small/unknown employee count. Serves HOA communities across KY/OH/IN tri-state.
- **Key People:** Christopher T. Herald (Owner), Jennifer Herald (VP of Accounting)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress website. No HOA management software confirmed.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Birdeye 4.3/5 (531 reviews) with recurring complaints:
  - Fire damage response: *"Sustained water and smoke damage from a fire — Vertex did nothing to start repairs within three months"*
  - Snow removal: *"When it snows the company hired by Vertex makes excuses for why snow removal isn't possible"*
  - Responsiveness: *"They look for reasons not to take care of issues — I had owned my home for two years and Vertex had not taken care of one issue that was their responsibility"*
  - Billing confusion around late fees on timely payments
- **Why:** High review volume (531) reveals recurring vendor management failures and maintenance response issues. Three months without acting on fire damage is a serious workflow breakdown. Family-owned NKY firm.

### Advantage Property Management
- **Website:** https://www.advantagepropertyoh.org/
- **Size:** ~2-5 employees. Specializes in condo association management.
- **Founded:** 1985 (40+ years).
- **Key People:** Dan A. Bailey (President — BS ChE Ohio University 1971, MBA Finance Xavier 1991, rental property owner since 1974), Millie (lead PM), Erin Taylor (PM)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic HTML website (no CMS detected). No HOA software identified. Very likely manual/spreadsheet-based.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 1.6 star rating from 11 reviewers on Chamber of Commerce directory
  - Very small team managing condo associations — stretched thin
  - Dated basic HTML website signals minimal tech investment
- **Why:** 40-year veteran with engineering + finance background running operations stuck in the 1990s. Small but the owner's analytical background (ChE + MBA Finance) means he'd understand ROI arguments. May resist change but would "get" the value proposition intellectually.

### Student Housing Management
- **Website:** https://studenthousingmgmt.com/
- **Size:** Est. 5-15 employees. Manages student apartments near UC (Cincinnati) and Miami University (Oxford).
- **Key People:** Unknown — no team page found.
- **Tech Stack:** Basic WordPress site. Online payment mentioned. No evidence of AppFolio/Yardi/Buildium.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Very low online footprint — no team page, no reviews, no BBB profile
  - Two-campus geographic complexity
  - Student housing seasonal cycles (lease-ups, move-in/move-out) demand tight processes
- **Why:** No visible ops infrastructure for a two-campus student housing operation. The annual turnover cycle is brutal — every lease-up exposes process gaps. Needs direct outreach to identify ownership and confirm pain.

### Flyco Management
- **Website:** http://www.flycomgt.com/ (also ucrents.com)
- **Size:** Est. 5-10 employees. Student rentals near Xavier University and UC.
- **Key People:** Mike Flynn (Owner/Manager)
- **Tech Stack:** Very basic static HTML website. Almost certainly spreadsheets or paper-based.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Rental Protection Agency complaint: Case #22-9976 regarding lease termination dispute
  - Extremely dated website (basic HTML, not responsive)
  - Very small online footprint — no Glassdoor, no BBB
- **Why:** Classic small-operator student housing landlord with dated website and a filed complaint. Mike Flynn manages everything personally. Student housing near two universities = intense seasonal operational demand with no visible systems support.

### Disqualified
- **Towne Properties** — 500-1,000 employees, too large
- **CMC Properties / Community Management Corp** — 110-200 employees, 42 locations, too large
- **PLK Communities** — 150-200+ employees, 7,000+ apartment homes, too large
- **Cedar Management Group** — 200-500 employees, national chain (Charlotte NC HQ)
- **Elite Management Services** — Merged into Cedar Management Group Oct 2025
- **Associa Real Property Management** — National chain
- **Peak Property Group** — Acquired by Coastal Ridge Real Estate, no longer independent
- **Clark Simson Miller** — National remote-only HOA accounting (Knoxville TN)
- **L&B Management** — 1-4 employees, below minimum + defensive owner (threatens defamation lawsuits)
- **Pulse Property Management** — 4 employees, below minimum
- **Shelby Management** — Primarily Columbus/OSU-focused

# RESTAURANTS/HOSPITALITY (Batches 13-15) — NEW VERTICAL

**Added 2026-02-12 | +15 new prospects (Batch 13) | Running total: 298/500**

## Industry Context

Cincinnati's restaurant scene is vibrant but operationally brutal. The city has a deep bench of multi-unit operators, chef-driven restaurant groups, and catering companies — but beneath the Instagram-worthy food photos, the back-of-house operations are often held together by duct tape and institutional memory.

**Three pain patterns dominate this vertical:**

1. **Scheduling chaos** is epidemic. Employee reviews across every sub-segment cite inconsistent scheduling, last-minute changes, punitive hour adjustments, and no-call/no-show management. Multi-unit operators compound this — scheduling across 4-7 locations with different concepts and different staffing models is nearly impossible without systems.

2. **Post-merger/expansion growing pains.** Cincinnati has seen a wave of restaurant group consolidation (DelightMore merging two catering companies, Strong's expanding from 1 to 5 locations across 3 states, E+O Kitchen adding a 3rd location despite documented financial issues). Each expansion strains processes that were designed for a single location.

3. **Franchise operator gaps.** National brands mandate POS and ordering systems but leave scheduling, payroll, inventory, and multi-unit coordination to the franchisee. A local operator running 4-6 franchise locations has the operational complexity of a small business but none of the corporate support for back-office systems.

The Cincinnati restaurant market is also experiencing a contraction cycle — Pesola Hospitality closed 3 concepts (Jan 2025), Catch-a-Fire closed 3 of 4 locations (Jan 2026), A Tavola OTR closed (Dec 2025). Operators who survive will be those who tighten operations. This is a buying moment.

## Priority 1

### Cafeo Hospitality Group (incl. Bell Event Centre)
- **Website:** https://cafeohospitality.com/
- **Size:** ~50-80 employees across 7 active concepts in 4 cities
- **Concepts:** Incline Public House, Jefferson Social, Press on Monmouth, Press at the Atrium, The Green Line Kitchen & Cocktails, Billy Yanks (Hamilton), Bell Event Centre, Incline Smoke Shack
- **Founded:** 1995 (31 years). Founded by brothers Tony and Dominic Cafeo.
- **Key People:** Christy Cafeo (President), Tony Cafeo (co-founder), Dominic Cafeo (co-founder)
- **Tech Stack:** OpenTable reservations. Upserve/Lightspeed POS. DoorDash. WeddingWire/The Knot/Eventective/Cvent for Bell Event Centre. Custom website.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed (Incline Public House): "Long hours" challenge
  - Bell Event Centre Indeed: *"More suited for teenagers which is mostly who they manage to keep as employees, making it good for temporary work or a summer job."*
  - Recently closed Somm Wine Bar+Kitchen (March 2025) — operational pressure
  - 7 diverse concepts across Cincinnati, Newport KY, Fort Thomas KY, and Hamilton OH — coordination nightmare
- **Why:** Family-founded group with 7 diverse concepts across 4 cities. The mix of event venue, full-service restaurants, and casual concepts means scheduling across very different staffing models. Recently closing a concept signals they're looking to tighten operations. Bell Event Centre's "teenage workforce" characterization implies high turnover and no SOPs.

### E+O Kitchen (Earth and Ocean Restaurant Group)
- **Website:** https://eokitchen.com/
- **Size:** ~40-60 employees across 3 locations (Hyde Park, The Banks, Loveland)
- **Founded:** ~2015 (11 years). Loveland location opened late 2024.
- **Key People:** Mike Hama (founder/owner), Tim Weiss (Director of Operations), Tony Castelli (Marketing Director)
- **Tech Stack:** Tock for reservations. Squarespace website. DoorDash.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed 3.2/5 (6 reviews): *"The company is in constant financial trouble, they don't pay vendors on time, a lot of the time employee checks have bounced, it is just poorly ran by the management and owner."*
  - *"My check bounced 4 times during my time with the company."*
  - *"Hired with promises of paid vacation, quarterly bonus, health insurance, and possible raise after 3 months, none was given."*
  - *"High mental endurance is needed to deal with terrible management."*
  - Scheduling: managers scheduling with *"little time from finishing school or other jobs"*
- **Why:** The strongest documented pain in this batch — bounced employee checks and unpaid vendors while expanding to a 3rd location. This is a company in operational crisis that needs systems for cash flow visibility, scheduling, and multi-unit management. The Director of Operations (Tim Weiss) would be the key contact.

### Strong's Brick Oven Pizzeria
- **Website:** https://www.strongsbrickovenpizza.com/
- **Size:** ~25-40 employees across 5 locations in 3 states (IN, OH, KY)
- **Founded:** 2012 (14 years). Original location Lawrenceburg, IN.
- **Key People:** Christian Strong (Owner, Pizza Boy LLC)
- **Tech Stack:** Popmenu for online ordering (powers website). DoorDash integration.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Rapid expansion from 1 to 5 locations across 3 states
  - Newport KY location appears closed (Yelp)
  - Single owner stretching across wide geography
  - No major negative employee reviews but growth pattern = inherent scaling pain
- **Why:** Classic owner-operator scaling story. Grew from 1 location to 5 across three states, with one location already closed. The geographic spread across IN/OH/KY with a single owner makes multi-unit visibility and scheduling extremely difficult. Already piecing together tech (Popmenu) but needs operational systems.

### DelightMore (formerly Vonderhaar's + Funky's Catering)
- **Website:** https://delightmore.com/ / https://vonderhaars.com
- **Size:** 51-200 employees (LinkedIn). ~45 contributed Indeed salary data.
- **Founded:** Vonderhaar's 1973 (51+ years). Funky's founded separately. Merged 2022 under "DelightMore" brand, rebranded spring 2023.
- **Key People:** Don Vonderhaar (Co-Founder/Owner), Michael "Funky" Forgus (Co-Founder/Owner), Lori Haines (Sales/Client Services)
- **Tech Stack:** Custom CMS website. WeddingWire + The Knot for lead gen. Unknown POS/scheduling.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed (Funky's): *"The business is definitely very shady when it comes to pay out — missing hours, tips take THREE MONTHS to get to you."*
  - *"The culture is terrible... Both were horrible."*
  - Glassdoor 3.8/5, only 63% recommend (15 reviews)
  - Positive: *"Fair wages, flexible scheduling, paid training"*
  - Post-merger integration of two legacy catering companies = systems combining
- **Why:** Post-merger integration of two established catering companies is a textbook ops pain point. Three-month tip delays and missing hours suggest broken back-of-house payroll processes. At 51-200 employees, they're large enough to need systems but likely still running on legacy workflows from two different companies that haven't been unified.

### Elegant Fare Catering & Events
- **Website:** https://elegantfare.com/
- **Size:** 47 employees
- **Founded:** 1981 (43+ years). Acquired by the Pradhans in 2020.
- **Key People:** Raj Pradhan (Managing Director/Owner — CPA, MBA), Emily Gibbons Pradhan (Owner), Renee Fink (20+ year veteran), Kyle (Events Manager, ex-Newport Aquarium)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress website. WeddingWire + The Knot for leads. Unknown POS/scheduling.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed Oct 2024: *"Tips/pay are low and management avoids questions about tipping."*
  - *"Work days/hours are on-call and as needed, with no set hours"*
  - *"The hardest part of the job was not knowing where they were going the next day or what event they were working."*
  - *"Inconsistent standards for contracts and office managers not familiar with kitchen hours."*
  - 3.9/5 Indeed (8 reviews). New ownership since 2020.
- **Why:** Scheduling chaos is documented — employees don't know where they're going the next day. New ownership since 2020 with a CPA/MBA at the helm means a financially minded buyer who understands ROI on ops improvements. 47 employees is the sweet spot. Raj Pradhan is exactly the "Reluctant Operator" who can be sold on systems.

### Baker Family — Firehouse Subs (5 locations)
- **Size:** ~40-60 employees across 5 Firehouse Subs locations including Lawrenceburg, IN.
- **Key People:** Christopher Baker (Franchisee/Owner, former GM), Kaitlyn Baker (Co-Owner)
- **Tech Stack:** Firehouse mandated POS. Franchisee handles own scheduling — likely paper or basic tools. No centralized ops layer.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed Cincinnati: *"Management has little respect for night staff"* and *"the GM is very rude and selfish"*
  - *"Schedules are created for a 6-day work week regardless if employees are scheduled 22 hours a week to 39 hours a week"*
  - *"You will be asked to leave early if business is slow"* — reactive scheduling
  - *"Several shifts that were 11-12 hours due to unreliability in scheduling"*
  - *"The HR team should investigate payments and communication at a specific location"*
- **Why:** Grew from GM to 5-unit operator rapidly. Pain signals point directly to scheduling inconsistency and manager-to-staff communication breakdowns across locations. With 5 stores and no centralized ops layer, textbook case for multi-location workforce coordination. LinkedIn outreach recommended — no operator website.

### Nwaisser Family — Gold Star Chili (6 locations)
- **Size:** ~45-70 employees across 6 Gold Star locations in Cincinnati/NKY.
- **Key People:** Rami Nwaisser (Owner/Operator, GSC Crittenden Inc). Started as dishwasher ~30 years ago.
- **Tech Stack:** Gold Star mandated POS/menu systems. Scheduling left to individual franchisees. No centralized scheduling tools.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed Gold Star Cincinnati: *"You will either get barely any hours or you will work 6 days a week. I worked up to 12 days in a row at times without a day off."*
  - *"After 2 weeks you will wanna walk out. You will get called in on all your off days."*
  - *"The management treats its employees horrible. I was scared to call off even when my son was sick because she would take days away from me the following week."*
  - Note: reviews are brand-wide Cincinnati, not confirmed Nwaisser-specific.
- **Why:** 6-location operator who rose through the ranks — operationally strong but managing by instinct. The 12-day stretches and punitive hour reductions revealed in Indeed reviews are exactly what workforce management systems address. LinkedIn outreach recommended.

### Vilaboy & Wacker — Wingstop (4 locations)
- **Size:** ~30-50 employees across 4 Wingstop locations in Cincinnati metro.
- **Key People:** Maurice Vilaboy (Co-Owner — background in distribution, IT, marketing), John Wacker (Co-Owner — previously owned 14-location regional retail chain)
- **Tech Stack:** Wingstop mandated digital ordering + POS. Franchise-level workforce management likely basic.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed Wingstop Cincinnati: *"Management never scheduled enough people and never gave workers the opportunities to succeed"*
  - *"Pure favoritism"* — managers claiming *"You have to earn your hours"*
  - *"Hiring friends from outside instead of promoting from within"*
  - *"Scheduled long hours that aren't flexible if they're in school"*
- **Why:** Strong business pedigree (Wacker ran 14 retail locations; Vilaboy has IT/ops experience) but employee reviews reveal classic multi-unit growing pains. Their IT background means they'd be receptive to tech solutions. 4 locations is the sweet spot for needing systems but not having enterprise tools.

## Priority 2

### Wayne Brothers Restaurant Group (A Tavola / Taglio)
- **Website:** https://www.atavolapizza.com/ / https://www.eattaglio.com/
- **Size:** ~20-35 employees across 3 active locations
- **Concepts:** A Tavola Bar & Trattoria (Madeira), Taglio Bar & Pizzeria (Columbia Tusculum + OTR)
- **Founded:** 2011 (15 years).
- **Key People:** Jared Wayne (co-owner), Nicolas Wayne (co-owner), Jake Goodwin (Director of Operations), Billy Draznik (Business Manager)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed A Tavola: *"Most/all the management is pretty lazy, with employees constantly having to do tasks that are part of their job."*
  - *"Management is horrible, with obvious favoritism and targeting of employees."*
  - Glassdoor: "No benefits, long hours, high stress environment."
  - OTR A Tavola closed permanently Dec 2025 after 9 years — ownership cited needing "time to reset"
- **Why:** Recent flagship closure + documented management issues. Running two different concepts (sit-down trattoria vs. quick-service pizza) with a small team across multiple neighborhoods. The closure adds risk but also motivation to fix remaining operations.

### Jose Salazar Restaurants
- **Website:** https://www.mitas.co/
- **Size:** ~40-60 employees across 3 concepts (Mita's 130-seat downtown, Daylily Columbia-Tusculum, Safi OTR)
- **Founded:** ~2013 (13 years).
- **Key People:** Jose Salazar (Chef/Owner), Ann Salazar (co-owner)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Concept churn — closed Goose & Elder, closed original Salazar, opened Safi in its place, opened Daylily
  - 3 very different cuisines (Latin tapas, Moroccan wine bar, American bistro) = diverse supply chains and staffing models
  - Limited direct employee pain signals
- **Why:** Chef-driven group with concept churn suggesting operational experimentation. CityBeat Best Chef 2025. Less visible pain but strong profile fit as a husband-wife team scaling beyond 2 locations.

### Mazunte Taqueria
- **Website:** https://mazuntetaqueria.com/ / mazuntetacos.com / mazuntecentro.com
- **Size:** ~25-40 employees across 3 Cincinnati locations + Lexington
- **Founded:** ~2014 (12 years).
- **Key People:** Josh Wamsley (Owner/Founder), John Johnston (finances/partner), Josh Sobeck (project leader/partner), Eduardo Gervacio (Kitchen Director, all locations)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Three separate websites for the same brand = fragmented systems
  - Kitchen Director manages "all three kitchens" manually — scaling bottleneck
  - Partnership structure (3 partners with different roles) adds communication complexity
- **Why:** Three locations with three separate websites signals piecemeal tech approach. A single kitchen director spanning all three kitchens manually is a scaling bottleneck. The partnership structure makes coordination tools especially valuable.

### Chef's Choice Catering
- **Website:** https://chefschoicecatering.com/
- **Size:** 11-50 employees
- **Founded:** 1995 (29 years).
- **Key People:** Matthew Williams (Owner/Executive Chef/Founder), Drew Hester (GM), Kristie McGraw (Catering Sales)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Not BBB accredited for 29-year business
  - Customer reviews positive (4.7/5, 47 reviews) — fewer visible pain signals
  - Note: may have Kroger sourcing relationship — verify independence
- **Why:** Longstanding single-owner operation with a dedicated GM suggests the founder may be systematizing for succession. Fewer visible pain signals but classic succession-preparation candidate.

### Aynie's Catering
- **Website:** https://aynies.com/
- **Size:** ~15-25 employees
- **Founded:** 1996 (28 years). Started as a small deli in Covington, KY.
- **Key People:** Ayn (Owner/Founder — full name not publicly listed)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: *"No set schedule, favoritism, and high school cliques"*
  - 28-year business with entrenched informal management
  - Customer reviews positive but employee experience mixed
- **Why:** 28-year family operation with Indeed reviews citing favoritism, cliques, and no set schedules — classic signs of a business that grew organically without formalizing operations.

### Ayers Family — Jersey Mike's (4-6+ locations)
- **Size:** ~35-60 employees across 4-6+ Jersey Mike's locations in Cincinnati metro.
- **Key People:** Jeff Ayers (Franchisee/Owner), Nancy Ayers (Co-Owner), Glenn Ayers (Co-Owner/Ops — Jeff's son)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed Jersey Mike's Cincinnati: *"Managers would not give them any hours and were very inflexible with schedule"*
  - *"Only 3-6 hours a week, stores struggling to afford giving employees more hours"*
  - *"Scheduling provided with only one day's notice"*
  - *"Uncommunicative management — handled employee termination via text message on their day off"*
  - Note: brand-wide Cincinnati reviews, not confirmed Ayers-specific
- **Why:** Family multi-unit franchise with generational transition (Glenn as next gen). Last-minute scheduling and inconsistent communication are exactly what multi-location ops tools solve. Lower confidence on exact location count.

### Cincinnati Catering Company
- **Website:** https://cincinnaticatering.com/
- **Size:** Est. 20-50+ employees. Capacity for events up to 10,000 guests.
- **Founded:** 1934 (91 years). Family-owned.
- **Key People:** TBD — family ownership confirmed but names not surfaced.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 91-year family business with no public digital employee footprint
  - No Glassdoor, no Indeed presence
  - Basic website, minimal third-party platform presence
  - If they handle 10K-person events, back-of-house complexity is enormous
- **Why:** Extremely opaque 91-year family business. The lack of any digital footprint suggests deeply traditional operations. Needs direct outreach to confirm size, contacts, and pain. WATCH priority.

### Disqualified
- **Crown Restaurant Group** — 300 employees, 6+ restaurants, expanding to Columbus
- **Looking Glass Hospitality** — 201-500 employees, 8 restaurants
- **Thunderdome Restaurant Group** — 30-50+ locations, 250+ employees, national
- **Four Entertainment Group (4EG)** — Multi-city (Cincinnati, Columbus, Chicago)
- **Dewey's Pizza** — 27 locations, 1000+ employees, 5 states
- **Goodfellas Pizzeria** — 131 employees, 7+ cities
- **Boca Restaurant Group** — Upscale, likely 100+ employees
- **Jeff Ruby's** — 200+ employees
- **Skyline Chili / LaRosa's / Gold Star (corporate)** — National/regional chains
- **One Holland Corporation** — 39 restaurants, 1,000+ employees, mega-operator
- **Epic Eeats / By Golly's** — 11 locations targeting 20, likely PE trajectory
- **Pesola Hospitality** — Closed 3 concepts Jan 2025
- **Catch-a-Fire Pizza** — Closed 3 of 4 locations Jan 2026
- **Quaker Hospitality Holdings (Penn Station)** — 21 locations, 150+ employees, too large

# AUTO SERVICES (Batches 16-17) — NEW VERTICAL

**Added 2026-02-12 | +16 new prospects | Running total: 314/500**

## Industry Context

Cincinnati's independent auto service landscape mirrors the national trend: consolidation is relentless (Caliber, Gerber, Service King in collision; Mister Car Wash, WhiteWater Express in car wash; Tire Discounters with 190+ locations locally), but a stubborn core of family-owned shops survives on relationships and craftsmanship. These shops are operationally frozen in time.

**Four pain patterns define this vertical:**

1. **Multi-location growing pains.** The most acute pain is in shops that recently expanded from 1 to 2-3+ locations. Overbeck (1→3 shops), Smith Family Collision (acquired 3 shops in 3 years), Xpress Pro (transitioning 26 Car-X locations to independent brand), and Cincinnati Transmission (added 2nd location 2019) are all experiencing the classic "what worked at one location breaks at two" phenomenon — scheduling, parts ordering, customer communication, and quality consistency all degrade.

2. **Fleet service complexity.** Fleet customers (Midwest Fleet Services, Fleet Care, M&G Body Shop) demand faster turnaround, professional invoicing, warranty tracking, and fleet-level reporting that manual shops can't deliver. The fleet segment is growing but the shops serving it are still running on paper.

3. **Towing/dispatch chaos.** Schaffer's Towing (Gmail for quotes, 40+ vehicle fleet) and Bill's Towing (Indeed reviews citing workplace hostility) represent towing companies where dispatch, quoting, and fleet management are done by gut feel. A 90-year-old towing company using Gmail for quotes is the towing equivalent of Bernens Pharmacy using @fuse.net.

4. **Owner-operator bottleneck.** Across the vertical, the owner IS the process. Rick Lamping at Cincinnati Transmission, Mike Yeager at Northgate Transmissions, Dale Donovan at Donovan's — they're personally involved in every job, every estimate, every decision. When they take a sick day, the shop stops.

## Priority 1

### Overbeck Auto Services
- **Website:** https://overbeckauto.com/
- **Size:** ~15-25 employees across 3 locations
- **Founded:** 1971 (54 years). Steve Overbeck started after returning from Navy/Vietnam. Now run by son Matt (2nd gen).
- **Locations:** Madisonville, Springdale, Amelia
- **Key People:** Matt Overbeck (Owner/Operator), Steve & Ann Overbeck (founders)
- **Tech Stack:** Modern WordPress website. Online scheduling. Unknown shop management software.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Actively hiring Automotive Technicians on Glassdoor and Indeed — staffing pressure across 3 locations
  - Customer reported receiving unsolicited $6,000 repair proposal for a sunroof diagnostic and oil change — service advisor process/communication issues
  - Personnel calling in sick causing longer appointment waits
  - Service Advisor pay $17.32/hr — turnover risk
- **Why:** Three-location family shop growing faster than its processes. The jump from 1 to 3 locations creates scheduling, parts ordering, and customer communication complexity that back-office optimization directly addresses.

### Smith Family Collision Centers
- **Website:** https://anderson-collision.com/ / https://jernyernst.com/ / https://boruskecollision.com/
- **Size:** ~15-30 employees across 3 acquired collision shops
- **Founded:** Boruske Brothers (1960s, acquired June 2018), Anderson Collision (1950 as Bert's Body Works, acquired Dec 2019), Jerry Ernst (1972, acquired Oct 2021)
- **Key People:** Greg Smith (Owner), Melissa Smith (Co-Owner), Paul Addington (GM, Jerry Ernst)
- **Tech Stack:** Three separate websites (not unified). Likely CCC ONE or Mitchell for estimating. Carwise profiles. No online scheduling.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Acquired 3 shops in 3 years — each with its own processes, its own customers, its own systems
  - Customer service depends on individual heroics: *"Michelle kept me updated at each stage"* and *"Scott was a huge advocate with insurance payments"* — not systematized
  - Running 3 separate websites for one ownership group = fragmented operations
  - DRP/insurance coordination across 3 locations is inherently complex
- **Why:** Textbook post-acquisition integration pain. Three independently-run collision shops now under one family ownership, each with different processes, different websites, different staff cultures. They need unified back-office operations — scheduling, insurance coordination, parts ordering, and customer communication.

### Xpress Pro Tire & Auto
- **Website:** https://www.xpresspro.com/
- **Size:** ~60-80+ employees across 26 locations (10 Cincinnati, 13 Indianapolis, 2 NKY, 1 Dayton)
- **Founded:** 1980 (formerly Car-X franchises, went independent ~2024). Family-owned by Gorrepati family.
- **Key People:** Ranga Gorrepati (Owner), Pallavi Gorrepati (VP)
- **Tech Stack:** Template website. Online appointment booking. No visible shop management software.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB: customer charged *"$1,400 for an alternator for a 2009 BMW X5"*
  - Customer returned because *"vehicle was leaking oil, stalling, and smoking after service"*
  - Inconsistent quality across locations (CARFAX ratings range 4.5-4.8)
  - Just transitioned from Car-X franchise to independent brand — standardizing 26 locations without franchisor systems
- **Why:** A 26-location family business that just lost its franchisor's operations playbook when it went independent. Standardizing quality, scheduling, and customer communication across 26 locations in 4 markets without Car-X corporate is exactly the problem Ops for Shops solves. Borderline on size but the Cincinnati operations alone (10 locations) qualify.

### Midwest Fleet Services
- **Website:** https://www.midwestfleetservices.com/
- **Size:** 11-50 employees, 17 qualified technicians, 43,000 sq ft facility
- **Founded:** 1988 (37 years, originally Midwest Trailer Sales & Service, rebranded 2010)
- **Key People:** Bill Lottman (Owner), Chris McQueen (Trailer Shop Supervisor)
- **Tech Stack:** Basic website. No online scheduling. No visible shop management software.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed 1.8/5: *"The owner is very disrespectful, he will say whatever comes to his mind"*
  - Former TIG Welder *"fired 5 days after returning from parental leave"*
  - *"Job training is nonexistent"*
  - Not BBB accredited. High technician turnover.
- **Why:** The 1.8/5 Indeed rating and "training is nonexistent" complaint make this a high-pain prospect. Standardized onboarding, job tracking, and workflow tools would directly address turnover in a tight diesel tech labor market. Bill Lottman needs systems to replace his personality as the management approach.

### Schaffer's Towing & Recovery
- **Website:** https://schafferstowingrecovery.com/
- **Size:** ~12 employees, 29-40+ vehicles (light duty, flatbeds, heavy wreckers, 50-ton rotator)
- **Founded:** 1936 (90 years, family-owned)
- **Key People:** Jeff Schaffer & Jimmy Schaffer (Co-Owners, purchased from mother in 2004)
- **Tech Stack:** WordPress website. **Gmail for business quotes** (schaffersquotes@gmail.com). No visible dispatch software.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: *"ZERO PRIVACY with cameras and mics everywhere and in the trucks"*
  - *"Owners don't care about employees' opinions and home life"*
  - *"Limited vacation (3 days), requiring use of personal phones with no reimbursement, and favoritism"*
  - Customer: *"$550 to drive 30 miles and pull a unit 10 feet in 15 minutes at 1am"*
- **Why:** A 90-year-old, 12-person towing company with a 40+ vehicle fleet using Gmail for quotes. Fleet dispatch, quoting, and scheduling workflows need systematization. The employee complaints about personal phone usage and no reimbursement suggest there's no company-provided dispatch system.

### Cincinnati Transmission Specialists
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatitrans.com/
- **Size:** ~5-10 employees, 2 locations
- **Founded:** 2003 (23 years). Expanded with Sharon Woods Auto Care acquisition in 2019.
- **Key People:** Rick Lamping (President, 36+ years in industry, started at age 16)
- **Tech Stack:** Professional template website. Contact form. No visible online scheduling or shop management system.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Expanded from 1 to 2 locations in 2019 — managing dual-site operations
  - RocketReach lists only 3 employees — lean staffing / burnout risk
  - Added fleet services (suspension, wheel end, general fleet) = diversification pressure on small team
  - Birdeye 4.3/5, 22 reviews
- **Why:** Owner-operator who expanded from one shop to two and added fleet services on top of consumer transmission work. Rick is wearing every hat. Multi-location coordination and fleet scheduling are clear needs.

### Bill's Towing
- **Website:** https://billstowingco.com/
- **Size:** ~8-15 employees
- **Founded:** 1981 (45 years). Family auto services legacy 80+ years.
- **Key People:** Don Schnitzler III (Co-Owner), Chad Schnitzler (Co-Owner, brother), Brandon Lamb (COO)
- **Tech Stack:** Website with team page. No visible dispatch or scheduling tools.
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: *"Treated like dirt, with yelling and screaming, and being called stupid"*
  - *"Employees are too competitive, and will do anything to get you out"*
  - Positive: *"Managers are very kind and sweet"* and *"learned a lot about basic mechanics over three years"*
- **Why:** Two brothers running a 45-year towing operation with a COO already in place (Brandon Lamb) — that COO role signals they're thinking about operations. The toxic culture complaints suggest they need HR processes and performance management systems. Brandon Lamb is the natural champion for process improvement.

## Priority 2

### Donovan's Auto & Tire Center
- **Website:** https://www.donovantire.com/
- **Size:** ~12 employees across 2 locations
- **Founded:** 1958 (67 years). Third-generation family.
- **Key People:** Dennis Donovan (Board Chairperson), Dale Donovan (President/Owner, also works as mechanic), Denny Donovan (Co-owner), Tonya Darr (Office Manager)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Pricing transparency: *"Oil change costs increasing substantially"* / *"Refused to provide a quote before service"*
  - Generational transition underway (Dennis as Chairperson → Dale as President)
  - NAPA Auto Care but no visible shop management software
- **Why:** 67-year legacy business navigating generational handoff with pricing process gaps. Digital estimate/approval workflows would address customer friction and smooth leadership transition.

### Fleet Care Inc
- **Website:** https://cincinnatifleetcare.com/
- **Size:** ~15-25 employees, 12-bay facility
- **Founded:** 1989 (36 years).
- **Key People:** Chris Schneider (Sales Manager/Principal, 18 yrs), John (Operations Manager, 18 yrs), Susan (Office Manager, 20+ yrs), Dean Helcher (Service Manager, 16 yrs)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - No Indeed reviews — limited recruiting presence
  - Long-tenured staff (16-20+ years) = succession/knowledge transfer risk
  - Basic/dated website. No online scheduling or customer portal.
- **Why:** Well-established fleet shop with deeply tenured staff but no visible tech. When these 16-20 year veterans leave, the lack of documented processes will be a crisis. Ops for Shops can help systematize before that happens.

### American Auto Glass
- **Website:** https://americanautoglass.net/
- **Size:** ~5-15 employees
- **Founded:** 2005 (21 years).
- **Key People:** Troy Haney (Managing Partner/Owner), Steve Brissey (Managing Partner)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Indeed: *"Unable to keep employees employed due to lack of funds. The owner started the shop underfunded."*
  - *"Staffing to maintain attendance"* cited as hardest part
  - Telemarketing-driven sales model (cold-calling insurance customers)
  - BBB zero reviews despite A+ rating
- **Why:** Mobile auto glass company with telemarketing-driven sales. Lead tracking, appointment scheduling, and technician dispatch are pain points. Financial instability is a risk factor for closing a sale but pain is acute.

### Northgate Transmissions
- **Website:** https://www.northgatetransmissions.com/
- **Size:** ~5-8 employees
- **Founded:** 1978 (48 years). Mike Yeager has owned 15+ years.
- **Key People:** Mike Yeager (Owner)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Customer complaints: *"Unprofessional language"* and *"disrespectful communication"*
  - Warranty tracking issue: *"Transmission failed shortly after warranty expired"*
  - Owner personally involved in every repair — classic bottleneck
  - Featured in Transmission Digest. 5.0 Angi, BBB accredited since 2009.
- **Why:** Mike is the definition of an owner-operator bottleneck. Warranty tracking and workflow documentation would free him up but he may resist change given his hands-on approach.

### M&G Body Shop
- **Website:** https://mgbody.com/ / https://mandgcollision.com/
- **Size:** ~6-8 employees
- **Founded:** 50+ years. Purchased by Linda Weil in 1999. Women-owned.
- **Key People:** Linda Weil (Owner), Charlie Doll (listed as owner in some directories), Melissa (front desk)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Fleet body shop focus = faster turnaround demands and professional invoicing requirements
  - Two separate website domains (mgbody.com and mandgcollision.com) = fragmented presence
  - Works with all insurance companies = managing multiple DRP relationships manually
- **Why:** Women-owned collision shop with fleet focus and possible second location. Fleet customers require systematized communication and professional invoicing that manual processes struggle to deliver.

### Ulmer's Auto Care
- **Website:** https://ulmersautocare.com/
- **Size:** ~50-80 employees across 10 locations. **NOTE: May exceed 80-employee cap — verify before outreach.**
- **Founded:** 1936 (89 years). Four generations.
- **Key People:** Bryan Kauffeld (CEO), Gregory Kauffeld (Owner), Donia Swisher (Manager)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Rapid expansion to 10 locations
  - Service Advisor pay 10% below national average — turnover risk
  - Corryville location "temporarily closed for rebranding and training" Dec 2025 — stretching capacity
  - Loaner car fleet + shuttle service across 10 locations = coordination complexity
- **Why:** If within the 80-employee cap, this is a top prospect: 4th-generation family business that scaled from 2 to 10 locations and is clearly straining. But may be too large — verify headcount.

### Detail World Automotive Restyling
- **Website:** https://detailworldohio.com/
- **Size:** ~1-10 employees, 18K sq ft facility
- **Founded:** 2007 (18 years).
- **Key People:** TBD (self-taught founder — name not publicly identified)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - 527 Birdeye reviews for a small team = high volume
  - 18K sq ft facility with small staff = underutilization or heavy contract labor
  - Multiple service lines (tinting, detailing, ceramic coating, PPF, truck accessories) = scheduling complexity
- **Why:** Growing detail/restyling operation with multiple complex service lines. Job scheduling and capacity planning tools could help scale revenue.

## Priority 3

### Woody's Express Car Wash
- **Website:** https://woodyswash.com/
- **Size:** ~10-15 employees, single location express tunnel
- **Founded:** 2005 (20 years).
- **Key People:** Larry Woodcock (Owner)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - BBB not accredited — *"requested basic information but has not received a response"*
  - Equipment malfunction: *"Car stuck in wash for 10 minutes — rim damage"* — customer seeking $750
  - *"Management very unfriendly"* and *"inconsistencies in drying quality"*
- **Why:** Single-location tunnel wash with recurring equipment damage claims. Preventive maintenance scheduling and incident tracking could reduce liability. Limited growth trajectory.

### Disqualified
- **Tire Discounters** — 190+ locations, national scale
- **Midas / Meineke / Jiffy Lube / Maaco / Gerber / Caliber / Service King / Safelite** — National chains
- **AAA Tire & Auto Service** — Subsidiary of AAA Club Alliance
- **Gill's Car Wash** — Subsidiary of Gilligan Company (1,400+ employees)
- **Carriage House Car Wash** — Acquired by Tire Discounters
- **WhiteWater Express / Flying Ace Express** — PE-backed car wash chains
- **Muffler Brothers** — 17-location Ohio network, too large/distributed

# MANUFACTURING/FABRICATION (Batches 19-21) — NEW VERTICAL

**Added 2026-02-12 | +16 new prospects | Running total: 330/500**

## Industry Context

Cincinnati/Dayton is one of America's densest corridors for small manufacturers. The region's industrial heritage means there are hundreds of family-owned machine shops, metal fabricators, plastics molders, and printers — many founded 50-100+ years ago — that still operate on tribal knowledge, paper job tickets, and disconnected systems.

**Four pain patterns define this vertical:**

1. **ERP disconnection.** Even shops that have invested in ERP (like Tri-State Fabricators with JobBOSS2) often have quoting systems, quality systems, and scheduling tools that don't talk to each other. The Paperless Parts case study on Tri-State literally documents their "quoting system lacked integration with their ERP."

2. **Temp workforce chaos.** Manufacturing shops increasingly rely on temp agencies for production labor. Deimling/jeliho Plastics has temp workers *"scared to report issues because they fear being let go."* Spectra-Tech pays $500 hiring bonuses and $100/month attendance bonuses just to get people to show up. Managing a blended permanent/temp workforce without HR systems is a nightmare.

3. **Owner-operator bottleneck.** From All Craft Manufacturing (2 co-presidents who ARE the workforce) to Art Woodworking (Ralph Dickman running a 106-year-old shop with 25 open job postings), the owner is the single point of failure. These shops literally stop functioning when the owner takes a sick day.

4. **Certification vs. reality gap.** K&H Industries is ISO 9001:2015 certified but Indeed reviews say *"limited resources and direction for new employees."* HR Machine has an ISO 9001:2008 cert that may have lapsed. The gap between what's on paper (for customer audits) and what happens on the shop floor is where Ops for Shops lives.

**Full dossiers for this vertical are in:**
- `prospect-dossiers-specialty-manufacturing.md` (DF Electronics, Valley Metal Works, Spectra-Tech, K&H Industries, Powder Coating Specialty)
- `prospect-dossiers-printing-packaging-plastics-woodworking.md` (Deimling/jeliho, Art Woodworking, Queen City Printing, 3D Corrugated, Kahny Printing, A. Flottemesch)
- Machine shops/metal fab data inline from research agents (CMF, Tri-State Fabricators, Vulcan Tool, All Craft, HR Machine)

## Priority 1 (7 companies)

1. **Cincinnati Metal Fabricating** — 23 employees, 47 yrs. Indeed: *"poor sales and engineering management."* Hiring QC + sales roles. Owner works on shop floor = stretched thin.
2. **Tri-State Fabricators** — 25-50 employees, 42 yrs, 125K sq ft. Indeed 2.8/5. Admitted their quoting *"lacked integration with ERP system JobBOSS2."* Family-owned (Vogt family).
3. **DF Electronics** — 75 employees, $12M, 52 yrs. Indeed: *"The place is filthy"* and *"management is horrible."* Family-run (Fine family), no ISO.
4. **Valley Metal Works** — 34 employees, 80+ yrs. Indeed: *"3 owners constantly fighting against each other... this sinking ship."* Management 2.8/5.
5. **Spectra-Tech Manufacturing** — 60-84 employees, 28 yrs. Indeed: *"nepotism abounds"* and *"micro-managed daily tasks."* $500 hiring bonus + $100/month attendance bonus = retention crisis.
6. **Deimling/jeliho Plastics** — 50 employees, $23M, 50 yrs. Indeed: *"Can't keep good employees due to supervisors."* Temps *"scared to report issues."* 27 injection presses.
7. **Art Woodworking & Mfg** — 30 employees, 106 yrs. 25 open Indeed postings for 30-person shop = capacity crisis. No digital operations.

## Priority 2 (7 companies)

8. **Vulcan Tool Company** — 17 employees, 110 yrs. ISO + ITAR + JCP = heavy cert load for tiny team. New ownership 2020.
9. **All Craft Manufacturing** — 2-5 employees, 38 yrs. Co-presidents ARE the workforce. Basic HTML website.
10. **K&H Industries** — Est. 15-40 employees, 121 yrs. ISO certified but *"limited resources and direction for new employees."*
11. **Queen City Printing** — 5-10 employees, 100+ yrs. Has a dedicated cost accounting clerk in a sub-10-person shop = manual job costing.
12. **3D Corrugated** — 5-20 employees. 3rd ownership change in 13 years. New owner (March 2025) = greenfield ops opportunity.
13. **Kahny Printing** — 10-25 employees, 69 yrs. Fax number on website. Dual print + promo product lines on separate platforms.
14. **HR Machine** — 5-15 employees, 18 yrs. Outdated ISO 9001:2008 cert. Contact form only (no email, no phone). Women-owned.

## Priority 3 (2 companies)

15. **A. Flottemesch & Son** — 2-8 employees, 80 yrs. **AOL email address.** HTTP-only website. May be below 5-employee threshold.
16. **Powder Coating Specialty** — 1-10 employees. Well-run micro-shop. Owner wearing every hat. Small budget likely.

### Disqualified
- **Meta Manufacturing** — ~100 employees, exceeds cap
- **Faxon Machining** — Likely too large/corporate
- **Cincinnati Incorporated** — Large manufacturer of fab machines, not a job shop
- **O'Neal Manufacturing** — National subsidiary
- **Graphic Village** — Likely 100+ employees
- **PMC SMART Solutions** — Likely too large
- **Zumbiel Packaging** — Likely exceeds 80 employees
- **Pexco** — National corporation
- Various franchise printers (Minuteman, Allegra, PIP) — Not independent

# FITNESS/WELLNESS (Batch 22) — NEW VERTICAL

**Added 2026-02-12 | +12 new prospects | Running total: 342/500**

## Industry Context

The Cincinnati fitness market is dominated by national chains (Planet Fitness, LA Fitness, OrangeTheory) and franchise models, with a thin layer of independent operators in between. True mid-size independents (10-50 employees) are rare — most independent gyms are either large single-facility clubs or small boutique studios with fewer than 5 staff. The sweet spot for Ops for Shops is multi-location operators, legacy martial arts schools, and established CrossFit boxes where the owner-operator is stretched between coaching and business management. Pain signals cluster around scheduling chaos, manual billing, high turnover, and founders who can't step away from daily operations.

*Full dossiers: marketing/prospects/prospect-dossiers-fitness-gyms.md*

## Priority 1

- **Contact:** (513) 337-9830 / stephanie@bodyalivefitness.com (CONFIRMED)
- **Tech Stack:** Custom mobile app, WordPress site, ClassPass/Wellhub integrations, custom video streaming platform
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor 2.0/5 (35 reviews, only 11% recommend): **"Can be disorganized and roles are constantly changing"**
  - **"Fired employees unexpectedly with no explanation"**
  - **"No system in place to hold the leadership accountable"**
  - **"The owner ruins it for everyone"** (Indeed)
  - BBB complaints about deceptive trial billing
- **Why:** Worst Glassdoor rating in the entire prospect database. 64 employees across 6 locations and 3 states with documented disorganization — the operational chaos is not subtle.

### Cincinnati Sports Club
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatisportsclub.com/
- **Size:** 84-121 employees, single 110K sq ft facility on 15 acres
- **Founded:** 1990

  - **"Little to no communication and constantly being short staffed"**
  - **"Bureaucratic nightmare with employees on a totem pole"**
  - New CEO April 2025 = transition window for ops improvement
- **Why:** Largest independent fitness facility in the market with a brand-new CEO and documented management/communication breakdowns. May exceed 80-employee cap — evaluate in conversation.

### Fitworks Fitness Centers

- **Size:** ~64+ employees, ~9 locations across OH/KY
- **Founded:** 1996
- **Key People:** Linda Ortiz (Owner & Operator)
- **Contact:** Website contact form (GENERIC)
- **Tech Stack:** Manual billing and contract processes per employee reviews
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Employee literally suggested: **"Contracts should be a template on the computer with typing in prices and the billing should be in-house"** — telling you their systems are stuck in the past
  - **"Super high turnover rate"**
  - **"No set work hour schedule"** — hours kept under full-time threshold to avoid benefits
  - Norwood location CLOSED
- **Why:** 30-year-old multi-location gym chain where an employee is publicly begging for a computer template for contracts. That quote alone sells the pitch.

### Nishime Martial Arts
- **Website:** https://cincinnatimartialarts.com/
- **Size:** Est. 10-20 employees, 2+ locations
- **Founded:** 1973 (53 years — founder arrived from Okinawa)

- **Founded:** ~2000
- **Key People:** Jorge Gurgel (Founder, retired UFC fighter, also works as UFC interpreter)
- **Contact:** (513) 443-2048 / contact form (GENERIC)

- **Size:** 8 coaches, single 7,200 sq ft location
- **Founded:** 2008 (oldest CrossFit in Greater Cincinnati)
- **Key People:** Stephen Flamm (Owner/Head Coach, CrossFit Games athlete)
- **Contact:** (513) 429-4382 / stephenflamm@gmail.com (CONFIRMED — personal Gmail)
- **Pain Signals:** Owner uses Gmail as business contact. 18-year gym with accumulated ops debt.
- **Why:** Gmail as business email for an 18-year gym = red flag for ops infrastructure.

### Embra Studio
- **Website:** https://www.embrastudio.com/
- **Size:** Est. 8-15, 2 locations (Cincinnati OH + Crescent Springs KY)
- **Founded:** ~2015

- **Key People:** Rainer H. (Owner per Yelp)
- **Contact:** Website only (UNKNOWN)

- **Why:** 19 years old with a ghost-like digital presence.

### Queen City CrossFit
- **Website:** https://queencitycrossfit.com/
- **Size:** 10 trainers, single downtown location
- **Founded:** ~2021
- **Key People:** Siu Ping Lau (Co-Owner, works at P&G), Chad Wieldishofer (Co-Owner, works at P&G)
- **Contact:** Website only (UNKNOWN)
- **Pain Signals:** Both owners work full-time at P&G = absentee owners. Gym must run itself.

### Park's Martial Arts & Fitness

- **Size:** Est. 8-15, 30+ years
- **Founded:** ~1993
- **Key People:** Master Park (Owner/Head Instructor)
- **Contact:** Website only (UNKNOWN)
- **Pain Signals:** 5+ martial arts disciplines across age groups = complex scheduling. 30+ year legacy with informal processes.
- **Why:** Multi-discipline scheduling is inherently more complex than single-discipline schools.

## Priority 3

### Calibrated CrossFit
- **Website:** https://www.calibratedcrossfit.com/
- **Size:** Est. 5-8, single location
- **Founded:** ~2012
- **Key People:** Arjuna Smith (Owner/Coach), Dr. Brittany Smith (Co-Owner)

  - **"Management and Gossip Nightmare"**
  - BBB complaint: misleading case representation and poor communication

- **Size:** ~8-12 attorneys, ~20-30 total, 3 offices

- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor 3.2/5 (58% recommend)
  - Hiring Litigation Attorney-Partner AND Domestic Relations Attorney simultaneously

- **Why:** 56-year-old firm with 3 locations and two simultaneous attorney openings = operational strain.

- **Key People:** Francis J. Niehaus (Founder/CFP), Anne M. Niehaus (2nd gen)

- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor: **"high turn over low wages lacking better structure"** and **"Disorganized"**
  - Operating at **$367K deficit**
  - New CEO and CDO both starting 2025 = total leadership overhaul
- **Why:** New leadership inheriting deficit and turnover. Classic modernization window.

### SPCA Cincinnati
- **Size:** ~38 employees + volunteers
- **Key People:** Chris Seelbach (CEO, from politics not nonprofit)
- **Contact:** (513) 541-6100 / info@spcacincinnati.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Glassdoor comp/benefits 1.5/5
  - Indeed: **"worst place I've worked"**
  - CEO from political background, not nonprofit management
- **Why:** Toxic management reviews + CEO without nonprofit ops experience = needs systems.

### Last Mile Food Rescue
- **Size:** 16 employees + 750 volunteers
- **Key People:** Benita Capers (Dir of Ops & Technology), Eileen MacDermott Budo (CEO)
- **Pain Signals:**
  - Charity Navigator 3 stars. Avg comp $18,947/year
  - **98% program expense = zero admin infrastructure**

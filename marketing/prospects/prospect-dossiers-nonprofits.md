# NONPROFIT PROSPECTS

## Priority 1 (Strongest Pain Signals)

---

### Cincinnati Works
- **Priority**: 1-HIGH
- **Website**: https://cincinnatiworks.org
- **Location**: 708 Walnut Street, Cincinnati, OH 45202
- **Founded**: 1996
- **Size**: ~50 employees (staff, not volunteers)
- **Mission**: Eliminates poverty through employment coaching, job retention, and career advancement services.
- **Key People**:
  - Tianay Amat -- President & CEO (started May 2025, replacing retired Peggy Zink)
  - Amanda McDonald -- Chief Development Officer (started August 2025)
- **Contact**: (513) 744-4673, info@cincinnatiworks.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Glassdoor (12 reviews)**: "A lot of staff changes, high turn over, low wages, lacking better structure." "The CEO has an extremely high opinion of herself and senior management does a lot of performative dancing when the boss comes around." "About 30% of the time was wasted on useless meetings and quality improvement nonsense." "Very poor training that is inconsistent." Former Development Officer: "Due to transitioning phase, was a little disorganized when I was there."
  - **Indeed**: "Way too many changes that didn't also seem best for the team, their development and the needs of the community resulting in constant turnover."
  - **990 Data (FY2024)**: Revenue $4.88M, Expenses $5.25M -- operating at a **$367K deficit**. Salary expenses are 50.9% of total expenses.
  - **Leadership transition**: New CEO (May 2025) and new CDO (August 2025) -- entire senior leadership is new.
- **Tech Stack**: Uses **Salesforce** (has IS/Salesforce Manager position). Donation page on website. WordPress site.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: Brand-new leadership team inheriting a deficit and a disorganized operation with documented high turnover. The "transitioning phase" mentioned in reviews is still ongoing. New CEO and CDO will want to show early wins by tightening operations. Salesforce is already in place but likely underutilized given the reported disorganization.

### SPCA Cincinnati
- **Priority**: 1-HIGH
- **Website**: https://www.spcacincinnati.org
- **Location**: 11900 Conrey Road, Cincinnati, OH 45249
- **Founded**: 1873
- **Size**: ~38 employees (plus volunteers)
- **Mission**: Hamilton County's only open-admission humane society, serving all animals in need.
- **Key People**:
  - Chris Seelbach -- President & CEO (former Cincinnati City Council member; took role after Mike Retzlaff)
  - Jennifer Smith, DVM -- VP, Medical Services
  - Maria Miller -- VP, Development
- **Contact**: (513) 541-6100, info@spcacincinnati.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Indeed (7 reviews)**: Mixed. Some call it "the worst place I've worked" due to management issues. Others praise the animal care. Reviews of Greater Cincinnati SPCA mention "toxic workplace environment" and "management allowing bullying with no consequences."
  - **Glassdoor**: Compensation/benefits rated **1.5/5 stars**. "Love the animals, did not like the people."
  - **990 Data (FY2024)**: Revenue $7.67M, Expenses $5.04M. Appears healthy on paper, but low compensation driving turnover.
  - **Leadership transition**: New CEO (Chris Seelbach) coming from politics, not animal welfare operations. Learning curve.
- **Tech Stack**: Volgistics (volunteer management), Google Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel, Microsoft Advertising, reCAPTCHA. No visible donor CRM named. Online donation portal present.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: A 150-year-old institution with documented workplace culture problems, rock-bottom compensation ratings, and a brand-new CEO from a non-nonprofit background. Seelbach will need operational help to stabilize. The gap between "well-funded on paper" and "employees hate working here" screams process and management systems problems.

### Last Mile Food Rescue
- **Priority**: 1-HIGH
- **Website**: https://lastmilefood.org
- **Location**: Cincinnati, OH (Greater Cincinnati area)
- **Founded**: 2019
- **Size**: 16 employees + 750 volunteers
- **Mission**: Rescues surplus food from donors and distributes to community agencies fighting food insecurity, using technology and volunteer drivers.
- **Key People**:
  - Eileen MacDermott Budo -- CEO
  - Julie Shifman -- Executive Director / Co-Founder
  - Benita Capers -- Director, Operations and Technology
  - Crystal Cottrill -- Director of Distribution Programs & Partnerships
  - Erik (last name unknown) -- Director of New Business Partnerships and Food Donations
- **Contact**: info@lastmilefood.org (GENERIC), website contact form
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Charity Navigator**: 3 stars. Impact & Measurement and Leadership & Adaptability both scored 100, but overall only 3 stars suggests financial health concerns.
  - **990 Data (FY2022)**: Revenue $5.55M but average compensation only **$18,947/year**. Program expense ratio 98% -- almost nothing going to admin, which sounds good but means zero infrastructure investment.
  - **Glassdoor**: "LMFR has a fantastic culture and mission" but "non-profit companies offer lower overall salaries."
  - **Rapid growth since 2019**: 16 employees managing 750 volunteers with a tech-driven food rescue model. Operations complexity is enormous relative to staff size.
- **Tech Stack**: Technology-driven model (app-based volunteer coordination). Specific platforms not identified. Director of Operations and Technology role exists.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: A 7-year-old organization that has scaled to $5.5M revenue with only 16 staff and 750 volunteers. The near-zero admin spend means they are running on fumes operationally. Average pay under $19K signals either heavy part-time staffing or severe underpayment. The Director of Ops & Technology is the ideal contact -- she is already trying to solve these problems.

### League for Animal Welfare
- **Priority**: 1-HIGH
- **Website**: https://www.lfaw.org
- **Location**: 4193 Taylor Road, Batavia, OH 45103
- **Founded**: 1949
- **Size**: 10-45 employees (sources vary; likely ~10-15 FT staff + PT, with 941 volunteers)
- **Mission**: Oldest no-kill animal shelter in Greater Cincinnati, providing care for unwanted, lost, and neglected cats and dogs.
- **Key People**:
  - Devon Smith -- Executive Director
- **Contact**: (513) 735-2299, info@lfaw.org (GENERIC). Devon Smith: d***@lfaw.org (ZoomInfo partial, likely dsmith@lfaw.org -- INFERRED)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Indeed**: "A new director was appointed, and since that time, **over half the staff has quit or been forced to resign.**" Previously described as "great place to work with happy, cohesive, and supportive staff."
  - **Glassdoor**: Compensation/benefits rated **1.5/5 stars**. "Love the animals, did not like the people."
  - **Salaries**: $22K-$25K/year average -- poverty-level wages.
  - **Leadership upheaval**: Mass staff exodus after new ED appointment.
- **Tech Stack**: Not identified. Website is basic. No visible donor CRM or online giving portal beyond standard.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: This organization is in crisis. A new executive director triggered a mass exodus of over half the staff. The remaining team is rebuilding from scratch with poverty-level wages. Devon Smith needs operational systems and processes desperately -- she is essentially standing up a new organization inside an old one. The pain is acute and immediate.

---

### Santa Maria Community Services
- **Priority**: 1-HIGH
- **Website**: https://santamaria-cincy.org
- **Location**: Price Hill, Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded**: 1897
- **Size**: ~71 employees
- **Mission**: Catalyst and advocate for Greater Price Hill families to attain educational, financial, and health goals.
- **Key People**:
  - H.A. Musser Jr. -- President & CEO ($149K)
  - Julie McGregor -- Chief Program Officer ($99K)
  - Shari Patrick -- CFO ($98K)
  - Nune Sargsyan -- Chief Development Officer ($88K)
  - Hillary Williams -- Director of Supportive Services
- **Contact**: (513) 557-2700, info@santamaria-cincy.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Glassdoor (4.2/5, 25 reviews)**: "Staff is overworked and underpaid." "Different departments in different buildings with very different team and office cultures." "Lack of communication between different departments." "There isn't a lot of room for advancement." "The salaries are low."
  - **990 Data (FY2024)**: Revenue $5.03M, Expenses $4.51M. Healthy margin but salary+wages ($2.02M) is 44.7% of expenses.
  - **Multi-site fragmentation**: Departments in different buildings with disconnected cultures.
- **Tech Stack**: Not publicly identified. Donation page present on website.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: A 127-year-old organization with 71 employees spread across multiple buildings with documented inter-departmental communication breakdowns. Overworked, underpaid staff with no advancement paths. The multi-site fragmentation is exactly the kind of operational problem that systems and process improvements solve. The CDO (Nune Sargsyan) or CFO (Shari Patrick) are ideal contacts.

## Priority 2 (Good Fit, Moderate Pain Signals)

---

### Cincinnati Nature Center
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://www.cincynature.org
- **Location**: 4949 Tealtown Road, Milford, OH 45150
- **Founded**: 1965
- **Size**: ~57 employees (some sources say 70)
- **Mission**: Connecting people with nature through education, conservation, and outdoor experiences on 1,800+ acres.
- **Key People**:
  - Jeff Corney -- Executive Director (since May 2019)
  - Brittney Torres -- oversees HR and volunteer departments
  - Kristi Masterson -- Director of Operations and Engagement (membership, programming, events, facilities, trails, visitor services)
  - Karen Sieber -- Director of Development
  - Cory Christopher -- Director of Conservation
- **Contact**: (513) 831-1711, info@cincynature.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Indeed/Glassdoor**: Generally positive. "The pay isn't great as the company is a non-profit." "Long" interview process with "multiple interviews and tests."
  - **Revenue**: ~$7.5M annually. Well-funded relative to size.
  - **Operational breadth**: Kristi Masterson's role covers membership, programming, events, facilities, trails, AND visitor services -- enormous scope for one director.
- **Tech Stack**: Not publicly identified. Modern website. Donation portal present.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: Kristi Masterson's impossibly broad operations role (membership + programming + events + facilities + trails + visitor services) is a classic "one person doing six jobs" scenario. The organization is well-funded enough to invest in operational improvements. Lower pain signal intensity than Priority 1 prospects, but the operational complexity is real.

---

### Caracole
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://caracole.org
- **Location**: Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded**: 1987
- **Size**: ~67-80 employees (sources vary)
- **Mission**: Greater Cincinnati's HIV/AIDS nonprofit providing prevention, housing, and care services across an 8-county region.
- **Key People**:
  - Jeniece D. Jones, MPA, JD -- CEO (started December 4, 2024; replaced Linda Seiter who retired after 20+ years)
- **Contact**: (513) 761-1480, info@caracole.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Indeed (3.9/5, 20 reviews)**: "The pay is not equal to the work load." "Pushing 150 hour 12-day work weeks with no comp time." "No advancement path." "Leadership could be a little more transparent and communicate more with staff."
  - **990 Data (FY2024)**: Revenue $14.3M, Expenses $14.2M. Tight margins. Executive comp $322K.
  - **Leadership transition**: Brand-new CEO (Dec 2024) after 20+ year tenure of predecessor. Massive institutional knowledge gap.
- **Tech Stack**: Not publicly identified. Annual reports published. Donation portal present.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: A new CEO replacing a 20-year leader creates a classic "everything was in Linda's head" knowledge transfer crisis. Employee reviews cite extreme workload (150-hour work stretches), no comp time, and no career advancement. At ~70-80 employees and $14M revenue, Caracole is at the upper edge of the target size but the pain signals are strong and the timing (new CEO wanting to modernize) is ideal. NOTE: May slightly exceed the 80-employee cap -- verify.

---

### Clifton Cultural Arts Center
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://cliftonculturalarts.org
- **Location**: 3412 Clifton Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45220
- **Founded**: 2008
- **Size**: ~9 employees
- **Mission**: Community arts center serving 4,000 people/month with classes in visual arts, dance, music, theater, writing, and wellness.
- **Key People**:
  - John Muething -- Interim Executive Director (since Oct 2021; previously Marketing & Development Manager)
  - Leslie Mooney -- former Executive Director (still listed on 990)
- **Contact**: (513) 497-2860, info@cliftonculturalarts.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **990 Data (FY2024)**: Revenue $990K, Expenses $1.94M -- **operating at a $946K deficit**. Total assets $7.78M (likely building/capital campaign), liabilities $1.67M.
  - **Interim leadership**: "Interim" ED for 4+ years suggests either inability to recruit permanent leader or organizational instability.
  - **ED was previously the Marketing Manager**: Suggests the organization promoted from within out of necessity, not because of operational leadership experience.
  - **Recent $11M+ capital campaign** for new building -- operational systems likely did not scale with facility expansion.
- **Tech Stack**: Donation page present. Event registration on website. No CRM identified. Modern website design.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: Running nearly a $1M annual deficit with only 9 staff, an "interim" ED who has been in role for 4+ years, and a massive new facility from a capital campaign. This organization has invested in bricks-and-mortar but not in operational infrastructure. The deficit signals that revenue systems (donor management, event registration, class enrollment) are not keeping pace with the expanded facility's costs.

### Keep Cincinnati Beautiful
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://www.keepcincinnatibeautiful.org
- **Location**: Cincinnati, OH (serves 52 neighborhoods)
- **Founded**: 1997
- **Size**: ~10-15 employees
- **Mission**: Environmental education, revitalization, and graffiti/dumping abatement across Cincinnati's 52 neighborhoods.
- **Key People**:
  - Jonathan Adee -- Executive Director (20-year nonprofit veteran, $110K compensation)
  - Aaron Fromm -- Director of Development
  - Caroline Cain -- Applied Learning Coordinator
  - Kara (last name unknown) -- Environmental Education Director
  - Alistair (last name unknown) -- Environmental Services Program Manager
- **Contact**: (513) 352-4362, info@keepcincinnatibeautiful.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **990 Data (FY2024)**: Revenue $2.04M, Expenses $2.20M -- **operating at a $165K deficit**.
  - **Glassdoor**: Limited reviews (only 2 salary entries). One employee noted having to be "somewhat assertive to maintain their job duties" -- suggests role ambiguity or turf battles.
  - **Program breadth**: Education programs + graffiti abatement + illegal dumping + Adopt-A-Spot + neighborhood revitalization -- enormous programmatic scope for ~12 people.
  - **Recently hired Director of Development**: Posted opening via Green Umbrella job board -- fundraising infrastructure may be underdeveloped.
- **Tech Stack**: Not publicly identified. Website appears moderately modern.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: Running a deficit with a tiny team covering an enormous programmatic scope across 52 neighborhoods. The recent Director of Development hire suggests they are trying to professionalize fundraising, which means they need the donor management and operational systems to support it. Jonathan Adee is a 20-year nonprofit veteran who understands the value of efficiency.

---

### Inter Parish Ministry (IPM)
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://www.ipmfoodpantry.org / http://www.interparish.org
- **Location**: Cincinnati, OH (eastern Hamilton County and all of Clermont County)
- **Founded**: ~1974 (50+ years)
- **Size**: 11-50 employees + 200 volunteers
- **Mission**: Food security, clothing, education, and innovative programs supporting low-income families in eastern Hamilton County and Clermont County.
- **Key People**:
  - Lindsey F. Ein -- President & CEO (previously Director at University of Kentucky Center on Aging Foundation and ED at Alzheimer's Association)
  - Yvonne Brown -- staff
  - Martha Garrigan -- staff
- **Contact**: (513) 731-3770, info@interparish.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Charity Navigator**: 4/4 stars -- well-rated, which means they maintain accountability but may still have operational friction.
  - **990 Data (FY2024)**: Revenue $5.15M, Expenses $4.75M. Healthy. But "Other Salaries & Wages" only $374K -- suggests a very small paid staff relative to the $5M operation. Heavy volunteer reliance.
  - **Grants provided**: $2.1M in grants in 2023 -- significant grant administration burden.
  - **CEO came from outside**: Lindsey Ein's background is in elder care and Alzheimer's, not food security -- still learning the sector.
- **Tech Stack**: Not publicly identified. Two different websites (interparish.org and ipmfoodpantry.org) suggest fragmented web presence.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: A $5M operation with only ~$374K in non-executive salary expenses means an extremely lean staff managing enormous food distribution and grant administration volume. The dual-website situation suggests tech fragmentation. New-ish CEO from a different sector may be open to fresh operational approaches.

### Cincinnati Youth Collaborative (CYC)
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://www.cycyouth.org
- **Location**: Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded**: ~1990 (35+ years)
- **Size**: ~20-30 employees (estimated from role breadth on staff page)
- **Mission**: Unites volunteers, school districts, and businesses to create networks of support for young people; serves 5,000+ students across 4 school districts.
- **Key People**:
  - Amy Thompson -- CEO
  - Sr. Director of HR & Risk Management (name not confirmed)
  - JCG Senior Program Manager (name not confirmed)
  - Next Level Pathways Senior Manager (name not confirmed)
- **Contact**: (513) 621-4610, info@cycyouth.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Scale vs. staff**: Serving 5,000+ students across 4 school districts with ~20-30 staff requires enormous coordination.
  - **Multi-district operations**: Each school district has different systems, calendars, and protocols.
  - **Volunteer management**: Core model relies on matching volunteers with students -- logistically intensive.
- **Tech Stack**: Not publicly identified. Modern website with donation portal.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: The operational complexity of coordinating volunteers, 4 school districts, and 5,000+ students is staggering for an organization this size. Volunteer matching, mentor tracking, outcomes reporting, and multi-district coordination create a web of processes that likely rely on spreadsheets or outdated systems. The Sr. Director of HR & Risk Management role suggests they have some operational leadership in place.

## Priority 3 (Qualified but Lower Urgency)

---

### Breakthrough Cincinnati
- **Priority**: 3-LOW
- **Website**: https://www.breakthroughcincinnati.org
- **Location**: 6905 Given Road, Cincinnati, OH 45243
- **Founded**: ~1990 (30+ years)
- **Size**: 9 employees (+ AmeriCorps VISTAs)
- **Mission**: Four-year, tuition-free college preparatory program for underrepresented youth, also training the next generation of educators.
- **Key People**:
  - Executive Director (name not confirmed from search results -- experienced nonprofit executive, formerly at Girl Scouts of Western Ohio)
  - Development Director (former AmeriCorps VISTA at Breakthrough 2021-2023)
  - Program Director (10+ years in education and youth development)
- **Contact**: (513) 272-6601, info@breakthroughcincinnati.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Small team**: 9 employees running a 4-year program with multiple cohorts.
  - **Charity Navigator**: Rated. Board has conducted formal CEO assessment within past year -- suggests governance maturity.
  - **AmeriCorps reliance**: Using VISTAs for core functions means annual turnover in key roles.
- **Tech Stack**: Not publicly identified. Modern Squarespace-style website.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: Small but well-governed organization. The annual turnover of AmeriCorps VISTAs in key roles means processes and institutional knowledge need to be systematized, not stored in people's heads. Lower urgency because the organization appears stable, but the small team and VISTA dependency create real operational risk.

---

### Know Theatre
- **Priority**: 3-LOW
- **Website**: https://www.knowtheatre.com
- **Location**: 1120 Jackson Street, Cincinnati, OH 45202 (Over-the-Rhine)
- **Founded**: 1997
- **Size**: ~8-14 employees
- **Mission**: Contemporary black box theatre producing new and adventurous work in a 99-seat venue in Over-the-Rhine.
- **Key People**:
  - Bridget Leak -- Producing Artistic Director
  - Ri Moodie -- Managing Director
- **Contact**: (513) 300-5669, info@knowtheatre.com (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **990 Data (FY2024)**: Revenue $669K, Expenses $655K. Very tight margins. **$0 executive compensation** -- leadership may be underpaid or volunteer.
  - **Budget transparency**: Publishes budget openly, emphasizing getting dollars to people (staff and artists). Suggests budget consciousness but also tight resources.
  - **Leadership restructured in 2024**: Shifted to Producing Artistic Director + Managing Director model.
- **Tech Stack**: Not publicly identified. Website is modern. Ticket sales system present. No visible donor CRM.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: Very small operation running on thin margins with zero executive compensation reported. The recent leadership restructure suggests organizational growing pains. However, the small budget ($669K) may mean limited ability to invest in operational services. Best approached with a small-engagement or pro-bono/reduced-rate offer that could become a case study.

---

### Strategies to End Homelessness
- **Priority**: 3-LOW
- **Website**: https://strategiestoendhomelessness.org
- **Location**: Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded**: 2007
- **Size**: ~28-32 employees
- **Mission**: Leads the comprehensive system of care for homeless services in Cincinnati/Hamilton County -- coordinates shelter hotline, prevention, outreach, shelter, and housing solutions.
- **Key People**:
  - Kevin Finn -- President & CEO ($250K compensation)
  - COO ($126K)
  - CFO ($123K)
- **Contact**: (513) 263-2800, info@strategiestoendhomelessness.org (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **990 Data (FY2024)**: Revenue $36.3M, Expenses $35.6M. Most revenue is pass-through grants administered on behalf of partner agencies. Actual operating budget much smaller than topline suggests.
  - **Indeed/Glassdoor**: Reviews exist but specific quotes not retrieved in search.
  - **Coordination complexity**: Administers funding and coordinates services across dozens of partner agencies.
- **Tech Stack**: Not publicly identified. Modern website.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: While the 28-32 employee count fits the target, the $36M revenue (mostly pass-through grants) makes this organization operationally more complex than most in this list. The grant administration and multi-agency coordination creates genuine operational challenges. Rated Priority 3 because the leadership team appears mature and well-compensated, suggesting they may already have operational systems in place. Worth a conversation but not the lowest-hanging fruit.

## RESEARCH NOTES

### Data Confidence Levels
- **990 financial data**: HIGH confidence -- sourced from ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer, which pulls directly from IRS e-filed 990s.
- **Employee counts**: MODERATE confidence -- sourced from ZoomInfo, LinkedIn, RocketReach, and Cause IQ, which may count differently (FT only vs. FT+PT vs. including contractors).
- **Glassdoor/Indeed quotes**: HIGH confidence -- direct quotes from employee review platforms.
- **Leadership names/titles**: MODERATE-HIGH confidence -- cross-referenced across multiple sources but nonprofit leadership changes frequently.
- **Tech stack**: LOW confidence -- most nonprofits do not publicly disclose their operational technology.

### Key Themes Across This Vertical
1. **Leadership transitions everywhere**: Cincinnati Works, SPCA Cincinnati, Caracole, League for Animal Welfare, and Clifton Cultural Arts Center all have new or interim leadership. This is the single strongest pattern -- new leaders need operational wins.
2. **Chronic underpayment**: Nearly every organization has reviews citing low pay. This creates turnover, which creates process/knowledge-loss problems that operational systems solve.
3. **Volunteer management complexity**: Organizations like Last Mile Food Rescue (750 volunteers), League for Animal Welfare (941 volunteers), and Cincinnati Youth Collaborative (volunteer mentor model) have massive coordination challenges.
4. **Multi-site fragmentation**: Santa Maria Community Services, Inter Parish Ministry, and Cincinnati Nature Center operate across multiple locations with documented communication gaps.
5. **Deficit spending**: Cincinnati Works (-$367K), Clifton Cultural Arts Center (-$946K), and Keep Cincinnati Beautiful (-$165K) are all spending more than they earn -- efficiency improvements are existential, not optional.

### Suggested Outreach Approach for Nonprofits
- **Lead with empathy, not efficiency**: Nonprofits are mission-driven. Frame operational improvements as "more resources going to mission" not "cost cutting."
- **Target the ops person, not the ED**: COOs, Directors of Operations, CFOs, and Office Managers are the ones feeling the pain daily. EDs are focused on fundraising and board management.
- **Reference their 990 data**: Showing you have done your homework on their financials builds instant credibility. "I noticed your admin expense ratio shifted last year..." opens doors.
- **Offer a nonprofit rate or pilot**: Many of these organizations are running deficits. A reduced-rate pilot that demonstrates ROI will convert better than a full-price cold pitch.

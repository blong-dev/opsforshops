# Outreach Batch 001 — February 13, 2025

10 personalized emails for HIGH priority prospects (CONFIRMED emails only)

---

## 1. Christopher Finney — Finney Law Firm (Law)

**To:** chris@finneylawfirm.com
**Subject:** 16 attorneys across 3 offices — the coordination tax

**Email:**

Chris,

I saw on your site that Finney Law "utilizes highly productive technology" — which usually means you've cobbled together a few good tools but they don't talk to each other the way you need them to.

16 attorneys across 3 offices in 14 practice areas is a coordination nightmare. I'd bet someone on your team spends hours every week moving data between systems, reconciling calendars, or wondering why the intake process feels different in each location.

I'm Braedon, based in Cincinnati. I look at the software running professional services firms — specifically the gaps between tools — and deliver a plan to fix it. Local, no vendor lock-in, your data stays yours.

If this sounds familiar, let's talk. 30 minutes, no pitch, just a conversation about where things aren't lining up.

[Calendly link] or just reply if you'd rather pick a time.

## 2. Ryan Mooney-Bullock — Green Umbrella (Nonprofit)

**To:** ryan@greenumbrella.org
**Subject:** 4 to 16 staff — when the systems can't keep up

**Email:**

Ryan,

Growing from 4 to 16 people and tripling revenue is the good problem. Running a deficit while you're doing it is the part that keeps you up at night.

I'd guess your donor management, volunteer coordination, and grant reporting are all living in different places — and someone on your team is the human glue holding it together. That worked at 4. At 16, it's breaking.

I'm Braedon, based here in Cincinnati. I work with nonprofits that outgrew their early systems and need to get their ops lined up without blowing the budget or losing what's working.

30 minutes to talk through where things are falling through the cracks? No sales pitch, just a conversation.

[Calendly link] or reply with a time that works.

## 3. Elisabeth Risch — Housing Opportunities Made Equal (Nonprofit)

**To:** elisabeth.risch@homecincy.org
**Subject:** 97% grant-funded — the reporting never stops

**Email:**

Elisabeth,

When 97% of your revenue comes from grants, you're not just running a nonprofit — you're running a compliance operation that happens to do good work.

Case management, grant reporting, outcome tracking — I'd bet your team spends as much time proving the work as doing it. And if those systems aren't connected, someone's doing it twice.

I'm Braedon, local to Cincinnati. I help data-intensive nonprofits like HOME get their reporting lined up so the work doesn't drown in the admin.

Worth 30 minutes to talk through what's eating your team's time? No pitch, just comparing notes.

Best,
Braedon

## 4. Sarah Estes — Ohio Justice & Policy Center (Nonprofit)

**To:** sestes@ohiojpc.org
**Subject:** Case management + policy + education = three separate worlds?

**Email:**

Sarah,

Development at a legal nonprofit with case management, policy advocacy, AND education programs is a special kind of juggling act.

I'd bet your donor CRM doesn't talk to your case system, your policy work lives in someone's head, and pulling a unified report for funders means exporting three spreadsheets and praying the numbers match.

I'm Braedon, based in Cincinnati. I work with mission-driven orgs to connect the systems so you're not manually stitching together the story every time a funder asks.

30 minutes to talk through where the disconnects are? No sales pitch.

[Calendly link] or just reply.

## 5. Gidget McMeekin — Gaslight Property (Property Management)

**To:** gidget@gaslightproperty.com
**Subject:** When the system is so disorganized it loses rent checks

**Email:**

Gidget,

I read the reviews. "So disorganized it loses tenant payments." "No one on the same page."

1,800+ units and no one can find the rent check. That's not a people problem — that's a systems problem.

I'm Braedon, here in Cincinnati. I help property management companies figure out why AppFolio (or whatever you're running) isn't actually solving the chaos. Usually it's not the software — it's how the data gets in, who touches it, and where the handoffs break.

30 minutes to walk through where things are falling apart? I won't try to sell you anything, just help you see what's actually broken.

[Calendly link] or reply with a time.

## 6. Josh House — Realiant Property Management (Property Management)

**To:** joshhouse@realiantpm.com
**Subject:** 3 cities, 168 units, maintenance tickets going dark for months

**Email:**

Josh,

"Maintenance unaddressed for months" is the kind of review that costs you tenants — and sleep.

Three cities, one team, and maintenance falling through the cracks. I'd bet you've got a work order system, but something between the tenant request and the vendor showing up is breaking down. Maybe it's how things get assigned, maybe it's who's checking what, maybe the system just isn't set up for multi-location.

I'm Braedon, based in Cincinnati. I look at property management ops and figure out where the workflow is actually failing — not what the software company says it should do, but what's happening in practice.

30 minutes to dig into it? No pitch, just a conversation.

## 7. Bob Ochs — Blue Ash Industrial Supply (Suppliers)

**To:** bob@blueashsupply.com
**Subject:** 10,000 SKUs and the owner is the system

**Email:**

Bob,

I read that you walk the floor every day making sure everyone's in the right place. That's leadership — and it's also the bottleneck.

10,000 SKUs, $14M in revenue, and if you're not there, things stop. Customers getting ignored, inventory picked manually, and the system that runs the place is you.

I'm Braedon, here in Cincinnati. I help owner-operators like you figure out how to get the knowledge out of your head and into something that runs without you on the floor every day.

Worth 30 minutes to talk through what you're holding together? No sales pitch.

[Calendly link] or just reply.

## 8. Lauren Hartman — Hartman Painting Company (Blue Collar Services)

**To:** hartmanpainting@fuse.net
**Subject:** UC Industrial Mgmt grad running the office on a @fuse.net email

**Email:**

Lauren,

I saw you graduated UC with an Industrial Management degree and you're running the office at Hartman. I'd bet you walked in with ideas about how things could run better — and realized pretty quick that "the way we've always done it" is dug in deep.

Estimators texting quotes. Crew schedules on a whiteboard. @fuse.net email for a $4M painting company. You know exactly what needs to change, but changing it while the work keeps coming is the hard part.

I'm Braedon, local to Cincinnati. I help second-gen operators like you modernize the business without blowing up what's working. Your data, your systems, no vendor taking over.

30 minutes to talk through what you're trying to fix? No pitch, just comparing notes.

[Calendly link] or reply here.

## 9. Walter Ford — CMC Commercial Cleaning (Blue Collar Services)

**To:** wford5@aol.com
**Subject:** 50 cleaners, 40+ years, and an AOL email

**Email:**

Walt,

You've been running CMC since 1980. 50+ employees, commercial accounts across Cincinnati and NKY, and everything still runs through your AOL account.

That's not a criticism — it's a tribute. You built this with a phone, a truck, and a handshake. But at some point, coordinating 50+ cleaners through calls and emails becomes the job instead of running the business.

I'm Braedon, here in Cincinnati. I work with long-running service companies that need to modernize operations without losing the culture that made them work. Your data stays yours, no vendor lock-in, nothing changes unless it makes your day easier.

Worth 30 minutes to talk about what's taking up too much of your time? No pitch.

[Calendly link] or just reply to this (or the AOL account, whichever you check first).

## 10. Russ McGurrin — A.B. Bonded Locksmiths (Blue Collar Services)

**To:** ab@ablocks.com
**Subject:** 4th generation, tri-state coverage, 24/7 dispatch — all by phone

**Email:**

Russ,

90 years in business, 4th generation, and you're still coordinating tri-state service calls the same way your grandfather did — by phone.

That worked when it was one truck and one county. At 10-19 people covering Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana with 24/7 dispatch, it's chaos. Someone's always on the phone, jobs get double-booked, and customers are calling to ask where the tech is.

I'm Braedon, based here in Cincinnati. I help legacy service companies modernize dispatch and scheduling without losing the family business feel. No online booking overlord, no vendor telling you how to run your shop — just getting the ops to actually work at scale.

30 minutes to talk through how you're managing the dispatch load? No pitch, just a conversation.

[Calendly link] or reply here.

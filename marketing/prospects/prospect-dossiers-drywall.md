**Target Segment:** Independent Drywall Contractors/Companies (5-80 employees) in the Cincinnati tri-state area (OH/KY/IN within ~50 miles)
**Target Buyer Personas:**
- "The Backbone" = Office manager / scheduler who juggles crew dispatch, materials ordering, builder/GC coordination, punch list callbacks, and bid follow-up across residential and commercial drywall jobs
- "The Reluctant Operator" = Owner who built the business on craftsmanship but is now drowning in estimating, crew scheduling, materials coordination, customer communication, quality callbacks, and compliance paperwork

**Qualification Criteria:**
- 5-80 employees (sweet spot 10-30)
- Cincinnati tri-state area
- Independent (not national chain, franchise, or PE-owned)
- 2+ years in business

## PROSPECT 1: Cincinnati Drywall, Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Cincinnati Drywall, Inc.
- **Website:** https://cincinnati-drywall.com/ (also: https://www.cincinnatidrywall.net/ and https://www.cincydrywallinc.com/ -- multiple domains for same business)
- **Phone:** (513) 321-7322
- **Email:** cincinnatidrywall@gmail.com (CONFIRMED -- publicly listed on multiple directory sites and Yelp)
- **Location (HQ):** 659 Wilmer Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45226
- **Founded:** 1973 (53 years; multi-generational family ownership)
- **Employees:** 11-50 (ZoomInfo); LinkedIn lists 2-10 (likely undercount); BBB accredited since 2001
- **Revenue:** ~$5.2M annually (ZoomInfo)
- **BBB Status:** BBB Accredited since 12/13/2001 (Source: https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/drywall-contractors/cincinnati-drywall-inc-0292-14972)

### Services
Acoustic ceiling installation, drywall installation, drywall repair, metal framing, plaster repair, texture matching, and water damage restoration. Residential and commercial projects including new construction, remodeling, and repair. (Source: BBB profile, cincinnati-drywall.com)

### Service Area
Greater Cincinnati, OH and surrounding tri-state communities. (Source: cincinnati-drywall.com)

### Key People
- **Philip M. Mott** -- President. (Also referenced as Michael Mott on LinkedIn -- appears to be the same person, "Philip Michael Mott." LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-mott-69194213). Related to previous generation owner. Has lived in New Richmond, OH; Bethel, OH; Loveland, OH; Cincinnati, OH area. Runs the operation as a family business.
- **Jo Mott** -- Office Manager. Likely spouse or family member of Philip. Handles day-to-day administrative coordination.
- **Jacob Gundler** -- Vice President. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-gundler-03287535b/. Educated at Morehead State University. Appears to be a younger-generation addition to leadership -- likely son-in-law or family relation.

### Email Pattern
- **Primary:** cincinnatidrywall@gmail.com -- Confidence: **CONFIRMED** (listed publicly on Yelp and directory sites)
- **INFERRED personal:** phil@cincinnatidrywall.net or pmott@cincinnatidrywall.net (unverified -- company uses Gmail as primary contact, which is itself a major tech signal)
- The use of a **@gmail.com** address as the primary business email for a 50+ year old, $5M+ revenue company is an extremely strong indicator of minimal technology adoption.

### Pain Signals

**Quality Control / Operational Inconsistency (Customer Reviews):**
> **"The work performed was merely average at best with inadequate feathering at many joints and lots of pin holes."**
-- Angi customer review (Source: https://www.angi.com/companylist/us/oh/cincinnati/cincinnati-drywall-inc-reviews-150843.htm)

The same reviewer noted the estimator and finishers were "very polite, courteous, and respectful" -- suggesting the people are good but the processes and quality control systems are inconsistent. This is a classic symptom of a company that relies on individual skill rather than standardized procedures and checklists.

**Positive Reviews That Reveal Operational Model:**
> **"When customers use their time and labor rate option, jobs get scheduled immediately with service the next day."**
-- Angi review summary (Source: Angi)

This suggests time-and-materials pricing is used as a scheduling workaround -- customers who accept T&M get faster scheduling because there is no estimating bottleneck. This implies the estimating/bidding process is a bottleneck for fixed-price work.

**Multiple Domain Names / Fragmented Web Presence:**
The company operates at least three different domains (cincinnati-drywall.com, cincinnatidrywall.net, cincydrywallinc.com) -- a clear sign of no coordinated digital strategy, likely domains acquired over different eras with no plan to consolidate.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Gmail as primary business email** (cincinnatidrywall@gmail.com) for a $5.2M revenue company -- no custom email infrastructure, no Microsoft 365, no Google Workspace business plan
- **Three separate website domains** with no apparent consolidation strategy
- **LinkedIn company page** lists 2-10 employees (hasn't been updated/maintained)
- No evidence of scheduling software, CRM, project management tools, or estimating software
- No online booking, customer portal, or digital estimate request system visible
- No job listings on Indeed or other platforms -- hiring likely done by word of mouth
- Yelp profile appears to be the primary review management channel -- no active reputation management
- Website is basic/template-style -- no investment in digital presence
- **No evidence of Procore, Buildertrend, CoConstruct, Jobber, or any construction management software**

### Why This is a Top Prospect
Cincinnati Drywall is the #1 prospect on this list. This is a 53-year-old, $5.2M family business using a Gmail address as their primary contact point. The Mott family runs everything -- Phil is President, Jo is the Office Manager (the entire admin operation), and Jacob Gundler is VP. There is no visible technology stack beyond basic email. Customer reviews reveal quality inconsistency (good people, inconsistent execution) which points directly to a lack of standardized processes, checklists, and quality control workflows. The T&M scheduling workaround suggests the estimating/bidding pipeline is a bottleneck. Three separate website domains confirm fragmented operations with no digital strategy. Jo Mott is the textbook "Backbone" persona -- she is almost certainly juggling scheduling, customer calls, invoicing, and coordination manually. Phil/Michael Mott is the "Reluctant Operator" -- a multi-generational craftsman who has grown the business to $5M+ without modernizing the back office. This company has the revenue to invest in operations consulting but likely has never been approached with a solution framed in their language.

## PROSPECT 2: Pro-Grade Drywall, LLC
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Pro-Grade Drywall, LLC
- **Website:** https://progradedrywall.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 787-3660 (Steve Smiley direct); (937) 603-4505 (Brad Evans direct)
- **Email:** stevesmiley442@gmail.com (Steve Smiley, Owner) -- CONFIRMED on website; BEvansdw10@gmail.com (Brad Evans, GM) -- CONFIRMED on website
- **Location (HQ):** 2901 Eggers Pl, Cincinnati, OH 45211 (business address); Principal address: 6096 Country Hills Dr, Cincinnati, OH 45233
- **Founded:** LLC filed July 6, 2020 (as entity); however, the team brings **30+ years of combined drywall industry experience** per their website. Steve Smiley has been in the drywall business since at least 2011 per LinkedIn (previously at D. Roark Drywall).
- **Employees:** Small team -- 4 named personnel (Steve Smiley, Brad Evans, Ross Fry, Tyler Warren). Estimated 5-15 total with field crews.
- **Revenue:** Not publicly reported. Based on service scope (residential + commercial drywall, painting, flooring, acoustical, metal framing) and 30+ years of industry relationships, estimated $500K-$2M.
- **BBB Status:** BBB Accredited since 11/24/2025 (very recent -- just got BBB accredited 3 months ago). (Source: https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/drywall-contractors/pro-grade-drywall-llc-0292-90053787)

### Services
Residential and commercial drywall installation, drywall repair, painting, metal framing, acoustical ceiling tile and grid installation, interior trim and door installation, laminate/tile/hardwood flooring. Level 5 drywall finishing capability. (Source: progradedrywall.com)

### Service Area
Cincinnati, Dayton, Northern Kentucky and surrounding areas. (Source: progradedrywall.com)

### Key People
- **Steve Smiley** -- Owner / Manager. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-smiley-84a74617/. Has been with Pro-Grade Drywall LLC since December 2011. Previously at D. Roark Drywall. The website states the "Owner is involved in every aspect of the project" -- classic owner-bottleneck language.
- **Brad Evans** -- General Manager / Estimator. Email: BEvansdw10@gmail.com. Phone: (937) 603-4505. Handles estimating and job management.
- **Ross Fry** -- Administration / Accounting / Marketing. The fact that one person handles admin, accounting, AND marketing confirms there is no dedicated operations infrastructure.
- **Tyler Warren** -- Painting Services. Field crew lead for painting division.
- **Joe Ballard** -- Registered Agent (listed on Florida LLC filing). Address: 3172 Irving St, Sarasota, FL 34327. May be a legal/accounting contact rather than active in operations.
- **Elva A. Smiley** -- Listed as M, B, R (Member, Board, Registered) on LLC filing. Likely Steve's spouse -- involved in business ownership structure.

### Email Pattern
- **Steve Smiley:** stevesmiley442@gmail.com -- Confidence: **CONFIRMED** (published on company website contact page)
- **Brad Evans:** BEvansdw10@gmail.com -- Confidence: **CONFIRMED** (published on company website contact page)
- **Ross Fry:** Not publicly listed. INFERRED: rossfry@gmail.com or similar personal Gmail -- Confidence: **LOW**
- The use of **personal Gmail addresses** (@gmail.com, not @progradedrywall.com) as the published business contact for both the Owner and GM is an extremely strong indicator of zero IT infrastructure. These are personal email addresses being used for business -- no domain-based email, no shared inbox, no CRM.

### Pain Signals

**Owner Bottleneck (From Company Website):**
> **"Owner is involved in every aspect of the project."**
-- progradedrywall.com (Source: https://progradedrywall.com/)

This is marketed as a feature ("personal attention") but is operationally a red flag. It means Steve Smiley is the estimating bottleneck, the scheduling bottleneck, the quality control bottleneck, and the customer communication bottleneck -- simultaneously.

**One Person = Three Departments:**
Ross Fry handles "Administration / Accounting / Marketing" -- a single individual performing three distinct business functions confirms there is no dedicated operations staff, no bookkeeper, no marketing team. This person is stretched across every back-office function.

**New to BBB (Late Professionalization):**
BBB Accredited since 11/24/2025 -- just ~3 months ago. For a team with 30+ years of experience, getting BBB accredited this late suggests the business is in a growth/professionalization phase where they're trying to build credibility but haven't yet invested in operational infrastructure. They're doing the "visible" professionalism (BBB badge, website) before the "invisible" professionalism (systems, processes, software).

**Gmail-Based Business Communication:**
Both the Owner and the General Manager use personal Gmail addresses as their primary business contact. No @progradedrywall.com email exists. This means:
- No shared inbox for customer inquiries
- No email continuity if a person leaves
- No ability to track, assign, or audit customer communication
- Likely no integration with any business software

**Review Vacuum:**
Pro-Grade Drywall is "new on Angi" with no reviews yet. Only 2 reviews on Chamber of Commerce (5.0 stars). No Google Reviews profile found. For a team with 30+ years of experience, having almost zero online reviews suggests they rely entirely on builder/GC relationships and word of mouth -- no reputation management system.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Personal Gmail addresses for all business communication** -- no domain email, no Google Workspace, no Microsoft 365
- Website appears to be Wix or Squarespace template-based (clean but generic)
- No scheduling software, CRM, or project management tools visible
- No online estimate request form -- phone/email only
- No customer portal, no job status tracking
- No evidence of QuickBooks, Jobber, Buildertrend, or any construction software
- LinkedIn presence for Steve Smiley but not for the company itself
- No Indeed job postings -- hiring by word of mouth
- Phone numbers are personal cell phones, not a business line or VoIP system

### Why This is a Top Prospect
Pro-Grade Drywall is the ideal "growing but unstructured" prospect. The team has 30+ years of drywall expertise and offers a broad service portfolio (drywall, painting, acoustical, metal framing, flooring), but the business infrastructure is essentially zero. The owner is involved in "every aspect" of every project. One person handles ALL admin, accounting, AND marketing. Both the owner and GM use personal Gmail addresses for business. They just got BBB accredited 3 months ago -- a sign they know they need to professionalize but are starting with the wrong things (credentials before systems). They have almost no online reviews despite decades of experience. This is a company in the dangerous growth phase where revenue is increasing but operations are held together by personal relationships and institutional memory rather than systems. Steve Smiley is a classic "Reluctant Operator" and Ross Fry is an overloaded "Backbone" trying to do three jobs at once. The Gmail addresses make cold outreach trivially easy -- you can email Steve directly today.

## PROSPECT 3: Bosse Drywall, Inc.
**Priority: 2-MEDIUM**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Bosse Drywall, Inc.
- **Website:** https://bossedrywall.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 825-2763
- **Fax:** (513) 825-2025 (having a fax number in 2026 is a significant tech signal)
- **Email:** p***@bossedrywall.com (ZoomInfo -- partially masked, likely pat@bossedrywall.com or phillman@bossedrywall.com)
- **Location (HQ):** 3460 West Kemper Road, Cincinnati, OH 45251
- **Founded:** 1962 (64 years; family-owned multi-generational business)
- **Employees:** Estimated 10-25. The company states "most employees have worked for Bosse Drywall, Inc. for 12 years or more" and "all employees are employed by the company and have been trained by them." Long-tenured workforce.
- **Revenue:** Not publicly reported. Based on 60+ years in business, residential focus (custom homes + remodeling), estimated $1M-$4M.
- **BBB Status:** BBB Accredited since 1/14/1988 -- A+ rating. Member for 38 years. Also member of Home Builders Association of Greater Cincinnati for 30+ years. (Source: https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/drywall-contractors/bosse-drywall-inc-0292-12268)

### Services
Drywall installation (new construction), drywall repair, water damage repair, home construction drywall, remodeling drywall. Specializes in custom homes and remodeling projects. Free estimates. (Source: bossedrywall.com/services)

### Service Area
Greater Cincinnati area. (Source: bossedrywall.com)

### Key People
- **Patrick D. Hillman** -- Owner / President (also listed as Vice President on ZoomInfo -- may reflect a generational transition or dual title). ZoomInfo: https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Pat-Hillman/5968804805. Email partially visible: p***@bossedrywall.com.
- **No Office Manager, Operations Manager, Estimator, or other leadership publicly identified.** For a 60+ year old company with 10-25 employees, the absence of any visible administrative or operations staff beyond the owner suggests Pat Hillman runs the entire front office, or there is an unidentified family member/office person handling admin.

### Email Pattern
- **Pat Hillman:** p***@bossedrywall.com -- Confidence: **INFERRED** (ZoomInfo partial reveal; likely pat@bossedrywall.com or phillman@bossedrywall.com)
- **Generic:** info@bossedrywall.com -- Confidence: **INFERRED** (standard pattern; unverified)
- The company DOES have a domain-based email (bossedrywall.com), which is more professional than Gmail, but the ZoomInfo mask suggests it may be the owner's personal inbox rather than a shared business inbox.

### Pain Signals

**Phone Handling / Customer Service Breakdown:**
> **"I called the number listed, twice, and was hung up on twice."**
-- Yahoo Local review (Source: https://local.yahoo.com/info-15788919-bosse-drywall-cincinnati/)

The reviewer noted the person answering "did mention something about working with drywall" -- suggesting a field worker answered the phone while on a job and hung up because they couldn't take the call. This is a classic symptom of a company without a dedicated receptionist or answering service, where incoming calls go directly to whoever is available.

**Owner = Entire Front Office:**
No publicly visible operations, admin, or office staff. For a company that has been in business 64 years with long-tenured employees (12+ year average tenure), the fact that Pat Hillman is the only named person in the entire organization suggests an extreme owner-concentration model. Every bid, every customer call, every schedule decision likely goes through one person.

**Still Operating a Fax Line:**
The company still lists a fax number: (513) 825-2025. In 2026, maintaining a fax machine is a strong indicator that the company communicates with builders, suppliers, or inspectors via fax -- and has not modernized document handling to digital workflows.

**Website Says "Constant Communication" -- But Phone Gets Hung Up:**
> **"We strive to be in constant communication with our customers until the job is done."**
-- bossedrywall.com (Source: bossedrywall.com)

The contrast between this aspiration and the "hung up on twice" review reveals a gap between the owner's intent and the company's operational capacity to deliver on that intent. The will is there; the systems are not.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Domain-based email** (bossedrywall.com) -- more professional than Gmail, but likely a single owner inbox, not a shared/managed system
- **Active fax line** (513-825-2025) -- strong indicator of paper-based workflows
- Website is a basic template site (likely Wix/Squarespace/WordPress) -- clean but minimal
- No scheduling software, CRM, or project management tools visible on website
- No online estimate request form -- phone only
- No customer portal or job tracking
- No LinkedIn company page found
- No Indeed job postings -- long-tenured employees suggest hiring by referral/word of mouth
- No evidence of construction management software (Procore, Buildertrend, Jobber, etc.)
- 107 local business owners recommend on Alignable -- suggests Pat is doing peer networking but through social platforms rather than formal business development
- Hours listed as Mon-Fri 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM -- structured office hours suggest some level of operational discipline

### Why This is a Top Prospect
Bosse Drywall is a 64-year-old, family-owned institution in Cincinnati drywall with long-tenured employees (12+ years average) and deep builder relationships (BBB A+ for 38 years, Home Builders Association member for 30+ years). Pat Hillman is the sole visible leader of the entire operation. The company aspires to "constant communication" but customers report getting hung up on -- a direct pain signal that the communication infrastructure cannot support the owner's service values. The active fax line, single-owner email, and absence of any visible technology stack confirm this is a company operating on relationships and institutional memory. The long employee tenure is both a strength (stable workforce) and a risk (institutional knowledge locked in peoples' heads, no documentation). Pat Hillman is a textbook "Reluctant Operator" -- he has maintained quality and reputation for decades through personal involvement, but the business has no systems that would survive his retirement or absence. The medium priority is because the company appears stable and may be resistant to change ("we've done it this way for 60 years"), but the operational gaps are real and the generational transition risk is a compelling conversation opener.

## PROSPECT 4: McCool Plaster & Drywall, Inc.
**Priority: 2-MEDIUM**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** McCool Plaster & Drywall, Inc.
- **Website:** https://mccoolplasteranddrywall.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 353-9644; also: (513) 353-9677
- **Fax:** Not listed (but FMCSA/DOT registration suggests they operate commercial vehicles)
- **Email:** Not publicly listed on website -- contact form only. ZoomInfo shows email addresses at @mccoolplasteranddrywall.com for Gary McCool and Tim McCool (masked).
- **Location (HQ):** 4065 Hooven Rd, Cleves, OH 45002
- **Founded:** 1996 (30 years; family-owned, mother-and-sons operation)
- **Employees:** 11-50 (ZoomInfo); company describes itself as having management + foremen + tradesmen
- **Revenue:** ~$6.3M annually (ZoomInfo / PrivCo 2025 estimate)
- **BBB Status:** BBB Accredited since 6/23/1999 -- 27 years. (Source: https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/cleves/profile/drywall-contractors/mccool-plaster-drywall-inc-0292-1178056)
- **FMCSA/DOT:** DOT #706705 -- registered with FMCSA, confirming commercial vehicle operation (Source: https://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/query.asp?query_type=queryCarrierSnapshot&query_param=USDOT&query_string=706705)

### Services
Plastering (traditional lath and plaster, veneer plaster, ornamental plaster), drywall construction (metal framing, gypsum board assemblies, exterior sheathing), EIFS (Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems), acoustical ceilings, metal framing, stucco, cold-formed metal framing. Commercial and residential. (Source: mccoolplasteranddrywall.com, Blue Book ProView)

### Service Area
Tri-state area: Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana counties including Hamilton, Butler, Warren, Clermont, Brown (OH); Boone, Kenton, Campbell (KY); Dearborn, Ohio (IN). (Source: mccoolplasteranddrywall.com)

### Key People
- **Ruth Ann McCool** -- President / Owner. The matriarch of the family business.
- **Gary McCool** -- Estimator / Owner. Son of Ruth Ann. ZoomInfo: https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Gary-Mccool/2358781003. Email: ****@mccoolplasteranddrywall.com (masked).
- **Tim McCool** -- Estimator. Son of Ruth Ann. ZoomInfo: https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Tim-Mccool/2358780945. Email: ****@mccoolplasteranddrywall.com (masked). Title listed as "Estimater" [sic] on ZoomInfo.
- **Ron McCool** -- Plasterer Foreman. Son of Ruth Ann. Field operations leader for plastering division.
- **Lance McCool** -- Field Superintendent. Son of Ruth Ann. Overall field operations leader.
- This is a mother-and-four-sons operation where all leadership and management positions are family members. Ruth Ann runs the office, Gary and Tim estimate, Ron and Lance run the field crews.

### Email Pattern
- **Gary McCool:** gary@mccoolplasteranddrywall.com -- Confidence: **INFERRED** (ZoomInfo confirms @mccoolplasteranddrywall.com domain; first-name pattern likely based on masked ZoomInfo data)
- **Tim McCool:** tim@mccoolplasteranddrywall.com -- Confidence: **INFERRED** (same pattern)
- **Generic:** info@mccoolplasteranddrywall.com -- Confidence: **INFERRED** (unverified standard pattern)
- **Contact form:** https://mccoolplasteranddrywall.com/contact-us/ -- the website does NOT publish any email address, only a contact form. For a $6.3M company, not publishing an email address is an interesting choice -- either intentional gatekeeping or simply never set up.

### Pain Signals

**Family-Only Management Structure:**
Every single leadership position (President, 2 Estimators, Plasterer Foreman, Field Superintendent) is held by a family member. There are no non-family managers, no hired operations staff, no project managers. For a $6.3M company with 11-50 employees, this means:
- All scheduling decisions go through family
- All estimates go through Gary or Tim (2-person bottleneck)
- All field quality goes through Ron and Lance
- All admin/office work goes through Ruth Ann
- If any one family member is sick, on vacation, or leaves -- that entire function stops

**No Published Email Address:**
A $6.3M commercial drywall company does not publish an email address on their website. General contractors, builders, and commercial clients must use a contact form to reach them. This is friction that costs them bids.

**Levelset/Payment Data:**
On Levelset (construction payment tracking platform), McCool Plaster & Drywall shows "0 projects" and "typical contract pay terms and days to payment have not yet been reported." For a 30-year-old, $6.3M company, having zero data on Levelset means they are not using any digital payment tracking or lien management tools -- all payment tracking is likely manual.

**"Not the Cheapest" Feedback:**
> **"They are not the cheapest but you get what you pay for."**
-- HomeAdvisor customer review (Source: https://www.homeadvisor.com/rated.McCoolPlasterandDryWall.14491983.html)

This is a common pain signal for companies without estimating software -- they price based on gut feel and experience rather than data, resulting in bids that are sometimes higher than necessary (eating into margins) or inconsistently priced.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Domain-based email** (@mccoolplasteranddrywall.com) -- professional, but no email addresses published anywhere; likely individual inboxes for family members
- Website is professional and well-designed (better than most prospects on this list) -- includes dedicated pages for each service line, customer reviews page, feedback form, gallery
- **Procore profile exists** (https://www.procore.com/network/p/mccool-plaster-and-drywall-inc.-cleves) -- this means GCs they work for use Procore, but it does NOT mean McCool uses Procore themselves. The profile is a network listing, not an active account indicator.
- **Blue Book ProView profile** is active with photos, testimonials, location/contact info -- they invest in trade-directory presence
- **No evidence of their own project management, scheduling, or estimating software**
- No online estimate request system beyond basic contact form
- No customer portal or job tracking
- FMCSA/DOT registered (DOT #706705) -- they operate commercial vehicles, which adds fleet management, compliance, and logistics complexity
- No Indeed/Glassdoor job postings found -- hiring likely through trade union (IUPAT District Council 6 lists them as a Cincinnati contractor) and word of mouth
- Dedicated customer feedback page (mccoolplasteranddrywall.com/feedback/) -- they solicit feedback but through a website form, not through a systematic review/NPS process

### Why This is a Top Prospect
McCool Plaster & Drywall is a $6.3M, 30-year-old family business where every leadership role is held by a McCool family member. Ruth Ann (President/office), Gary and Tim (estimating), Ron (plastering foreman), and Lance (field superintendent) run the entire operation as a family unit. This is simultaneously the company's greatest strength (trust, accountability, shared values) and its greatest operational risk (zero redundancy, no non-family management, complete dependency on 5 people). The company does commercial work including EIFS, acoustical ceilings, metal framing, and ornamental plaster -- complex project types that demand scheduling precision, materials coordination, and documentation. Yet there is no evidence of project management software, no published email, zero Levelset payment data, and no digital estimating tools. Ruth Ann McCool is the "Backbone" persona managing the entire office for a $6.3M operation. Gary and Tim are estimating everything by hand/spreadsheet for a company doing commercial projects. The medium priority is because the website is better than most (suggesting some willingness to invest in professionalism) and the company appears well-run on reputation -- but the underlying operational infrastructure is almost certainly manual and family-dependent.

## DISQUALIFIED COMPANIES

### Valley Interior Systems, Inc. -- DISQUALIFIED (Too Large)
- **Reason:** 550-1,000+ employees per multiple sources. Revenue estimates range from $110M to $764M. Operates 7+ office locations across Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, Lexington, Nashville, Toledo, and Cleveland. 44 years in business, 8,000+ completed projects. This is a large regional specialty contractor, not a small business. Has dedicated management infrastructure including a full organizational chart on TheOrg.com. Far exceeds the 80-employee ceiling.
- **Source:** https://www.zoominfo.com/c/valley-interior-systems/123568348, https://buildwithvalley.com/

### The Patch Boys of Cincinnati -- DISQUALIFIED (National Franchise)
- **Reason:** The Patch Boys is a national franchise brand owned by BELFOR Franchise Group (a leading global franchisor in restoration and home services). The Cincinnati location is operated by franchisees Denny Rupp and Kevin Melton, but the business model, branding, systems, and operations playbook are all franchise-provided. Not an independent operation.
- **Source:** https://thepatchboysfranchise.com/, https://belforfranchisegroup.com/our-brands/the-patch-boys/

### M & E Drywall Finishing LLC -- DISQUALIFIED (Too Small)
- **Reason:** Estimated 2 employees and $100,000 annual revenue per Buzzfile. Women-owned business (owner: Emily Jacinto). Only ~6 years in business. Below the 5-employee minimum and far below the revenue threshold where operations consulting would provide ROI.
- **Source:** https://www.buzzfile.com/business/M.And.E-Drywall-LLC-513-462-6878

### JH Drywall Cincinnati -- DISQUALIFIED (Insufficient Data / Likely Too Small)
- **Reason:** No owner name, employee count, or revenue data found through any public source. Website reviews appear templated/generic ("outstanding job," "incredibly pleased," "exceeded expectations" -- all identical in tone/structure, possibly AI-generated or fabricated testimonials). No BBB profile. No ZoomInfo or LinkedIn presence. No Indeed or Glassdoor data. Unable to verify business size, legitimacy of reviews, or qualification criteria. Likely a very small operation or sole proprietor.
- **Source:** https://www.jh-drywallcincinnati.com/

### Keen Drywall -- DISQUALIFIED (Likely Too Small / Insufficient Data)
- **Reason:** Owner Gary Keen operates from Kings Mills, OH. 20+ years of experience, specializes in custom home drywall. However, no employee count, revenue data, or organizational structure publicly available. No ZoomInfo profile for the company. BBB profile exists but without size data. Appears to be a small crew operation (owner + field workers) below the 5-employee threshold for meaningful operations consulting engagement. Would reconsider if more data surfaces.
- **Source:** https://keendrywall.com/, https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/drywall-contractors/keen-drywall-0292-90042937

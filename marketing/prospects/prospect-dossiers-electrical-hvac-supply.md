## PROSPECT 1: 2J Supply Company, Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** 2J Supply Company, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.2jsupply.com/
- **Location:** Cincinnati, OH (HQ: 1456 N Keowee St, Dayton, OH 45404); 11 locations in OH, KY, IN, WV
- **Founded:** 1962 (63 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~55
- **Industry:** Wholesale HVAC distribution (heating, cooling, ventilation equipment, parts, supplies)

### Key People
- **Jason Trimbach** -- CEO (3rd generation owner)
- **Kevin Trimbach** -- President/COO (3rd generation owner)
- Email format: first initial + last name @2-jsupply.com (e.g., j***@2-jsupply.com per RocketReach)

### Contact
- **Email:** Contact form on website; email format is [initial]@2-jsupply.com [INFERRED from partial ZoomInfo data]
- **Phone:** Cincinnati branch: (513) 631-5552

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: Custom-built or templated site at 2jsupply.com with online product catalog and branch locator
- Has ecommerce/online ordering for contractors (2jsupply.com with login)
- Social media: Active on Twitter/X (@2J_Supply)
- Uses Google Analytics on website
- "2J University" training platform for contractors -- shows some tech investment

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- **Glassdoor (3.8/5 stars, 30 reviews, only 66% recommend):**
  - **"The company is going by way of too much micro management"** with **"high turnover in all job functions"** and **"poisoned culture"**
  - **"No integrity amongst employees and management, no principles or morals, and poor values and standards"**
  - **"Benefits are horrible and PTO is lacking and confusing in process"**
- **Indeed employee reviews:**
  - **"They don't promote from inside the company"** and **"if you aren't friends with the uppers then you won't move up"**
  - **"Too many people in charge who lack knowledge"**
  - **"Communication issues and unclear direction"**
  - **"Average to above average pay"** (positive)
- **BBB:** Cincinnati location is NOT BBB Accredited

### Why They're a Good Prospect
2J Supply is a classic 3rd-generation family HVAC distributor with 11 branches and ~55 employees -- right in the sweet spot. The Glassdoor reviews paint a picture of a company growing faster than its management systems: micromanagement, high turnover, and "poisoned culture" are hallmarks of a business where the owners are trying to maintain control through manual oversight rather than systems. The "too many people in charge who lack knowledge" quote suggests process chaos. With 11 locations to coordinate, the office manager at each branch (The Backbone) is likely manually tracking orders, inventory, and deliveries across disconnected systems. The 3rd generation transition is also a prime ops-improvement window.

## PROSPECT 2: Winstel Controls, Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Winstel Controls, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.winstelcontrols.com/ (marketing) and https://winstelcontrolsonline.com/ (ecommerce)
- **Location:** 10126 Transportation Way, Cincinnati, OH 45246 (also Hamilton, OH location)
- **Founded:** 1934 (91 years in business); current ownership since 1999
- **Employees:** ~20-49
- **Industry:** Wholesale HVAC, plumbing, hydronic parts and equipment distribution

### Key People
- **Daniel Jurkowitz** -- President/Owner (purchased company in 1999 when it had 3 employees)
- **Mike Jurkowitz** -- Vice President
- **Danny Jurkowitz Jr.** -- Chief Technology Officer
- **Email:** djurkowitz@winstelcontrols.com [INFERRED from LinkedIn/ZoomInfo data]

### Contact
- **Email:** djurkowitz@winstelcontrols.com [INFERRED]; format is [first initial][lastname]@winstelcontrols.com
- **Phone:** (513) 251-4343

### Tech Stack Clues
- Two separate websites: winstelcontrols.com (main/ecommerce with login) and winstelcontrolsonline.com (catalog/legacy site with .php pages)
- Ecommerce platform with product catalog and order tracking (AfterShip integration noted)
- Google Analytics, Google Analytics Enhanced eCommerce, reCAPTCHA
- Constant Contact (email marketing)
- Google Font API
- The two-website situation suggests a tech transition in progress or legacy system they can't fully retire
- Danny Jurkowitz Jr. as CTO suggests they're investing in technology but may be building internally

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- **Indeed (4.5/5 stars for Cincinnati):** Generally positive reviews -- this is a well-run small company
- **Birdeye (4.9/5 stars, 9 reviews):** Strong customer satisfaction
- **Growth signal:** Grew from 3 employees in 1999 to 20-49 today, acquired Barry Company in Hamilton in 2006 -- growth without proportional systems investment is a common pain driver
- **Two-website problem:** Running winstelcontrols.com AND winstelcontrolsonline.com simultaneously suggests fragmented tech, possibly a migration that stalled

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Winstel is a well-run, growing HVAC distributor with a clear tech-forward ambition (they have a CTO and ecommerce). But the two-website situation and .php legacy catalog suggest they're outgrowing their current systems. Daniel Jurkowitz grew this from 3 employees to 40+ and acquired another company -- that kind of growth creates back-office complexity that manual processes can't handle. The CTO son (Danny Jr.) makes them receptive to technology conversations. This is a "Reluctant Operator" who knows he needs better systems but may not know where to start beyond what his son can build.

## PROSPECT 3: A&S Electric Supply, Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** A&S Electric Supply, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.a-s-electric.com/
- **Location:** 5 Coordinator Dr, Erlanger, KY 41018 (Northern Kentucky / Greater Cincinnati)
- **Founded:** 1969 (56 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~16-20
- **Industry:** Wholesale electrical supply distribution with residential lighting showroom

### Key People
- **Tom Smith** -- President/Owner (son of co-founder Lawrence Smith)
- **Evan Smith** -- Warehouse Manager
- **Kim Bessler** -- Secretary
- **Raymond Saklawy** -- (may be at sister company, verify)

### Contact
- **Email:** inquire@a-s-electric.com [CONFIRMED - listed on website contact page]
- **Email format:** t***@a-s-electric.com (Tom Smith per ZoomInfo); e***@a-s-electric.com (Evan Smith)
- **Phone:** (859) 727-1111 (electrical); (859) 727-1136 (lighting showroom)

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: a-s-electric.com appears to be a basic/templated site with contact form
- No visible online ordering or ecommerce
- No evidence of ERP or modern inventory system
- ISP/generic email: inquire@a-s-electric.com (generic inbox, not individual addresses publicly)
- BBB Accredited since 2005, A+ rating

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- **Yelp:** 5 stars but very few reviews -- minimal online presence for a 56-year-old company
- **BBB:** A+ rating, accredited since 2005, no visible complaints
- **Office move 2024:** Company was relocating offices, impacting ~20 employees -- office moves are operationally disruptive and often expose broken processes
- **No ecommerce:** In 2026, a wholesale electrical distributor with no online ordering is losing business to competitors who offer it -- this is a significant competitive gap
- **Small team, family-run:** With ~16-20 employees and the owner's son managing the warehouse, this is likely running on tribal knowledge and spreadsheets

### Why They're a Good Prospect
A&S Electric is a textbook "Reluctant Operator" shop. Founded in 1969, still family-owned (Smith family, 2nd generation), serving the exact Cincinnati tri-state market. With only 16-20 employees, no visible ecommerce, and a generic email inbox, they're likely running operations on phone calls, paper, and maybe QuickBooks. The recent office move is a natural trigger for modernization. Tom Smith (owner) and Evan Smith (warehouse) are the decision-making duo. The lack of online presence and digital tools in a market where competitors like Becker and CES offer ecommerce puts them at a growing competitive disadvantage.

## PROSPECT 4: Lebanon Electric Supply / Middletown Electric Supply
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Lebanon Electric Supply, Inc. (dba Middletown Electric Supply)
- **Website:** https://middletownelectric.com/ (also lebanonelectric.com)
- **Location:** 602 E Main St, Lebanon, OH 45036 AND 6700 Trenton Franklin Rd, Middletown, OH 45042
- **Founded:** 1960 (65 years in business)
- **Employees:** 11-50 (estimated 15-30)
- **Industry:** Wholesale electrical distribution (residential, commercial, industrial), lighting, HVAC supplies, pumps, motors

### Key People
- **Tom Carter** -- President/Owner
- **Todd Carter** -- Vice President
- **Raymond Saklawy** -- Showroom Manager
- **Khoury Walid** -- Stock Manager

### Contact
- **Email:** Sales@lebanonelectric.com [CONFIRMED - listed on website contact page]
- **Email format:** r***@lebanonelectric.com (Raymond Saklawy per ZoomInfo)
- **Phone:** Lebanon: (513) 932-4015; Middletown: (513) 424-0888

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: middletownelectric.com is a basic informational site -- no ecommerce visible
- Dual-brand operation (Lebanon Electric + Middletown Electric) under one company
- No online ordering
- BBB A+ rating (Lebanon Electric Supply)
- Email is @lebanonelectric.com domain -- proper business email at least

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- **Minimal online presence:** Two locations but very basic website, no ecommerce -- similar gap to A&S Electric
- **Dual-brand complexity:** Operating two store brands under one company creates coordination overhead for orders, inventory, and deliveries
- **No Indeed/Glassdoor reviews found:** Too small for public employee reviews, suggesting very small headcount
- **"Hometown roots with big-city buying power"** -- their own marketing acknowledges the tension between being small and needing to compete at scale

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Lebanon/Middletown Electric is a 65-year-old, locally-owned, two-location electrical distributor run by the Carter family. They carry a broad product mix (electrical, HVAC, pumps, motors, lighting) across two brands, which means coordinating inventory and orders between locations. With no ecommerce and a basic website in 2026, they're relying entirely on phone/counter sales while competitors offer online ordering. Tom Carter (owner) is the decision-maker. The "hometown roots" messaging suggests they value relationships over technology -- making them receptive to tools that enhance rather than replace their personal service model. Rated MED because they may be too small and comfortable to feel urgency.

## PROSPECT 5: Eckart Supply (Cincinnati Branch)
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Eckart, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.eckartsupply.com/
- **Location:** Cincinnati, OH branch (HQ: Corydon, IN); locations in Louisville, Lexington, Clarksville, Evansville, and Cincinnati
- **Founded:** 1962 (63 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~143-200 (borderline -- may exceed 80-employee cap)
- **Industry:** Wholesale distribution of electrical, lighting, HVAC, plumbing, and tools

### Key People
- **Mike Bennett** -- CEO/Controlling Owner (since 2002; started stocking shelves in 1969)
- **Philip Bennett** -- President/CEO (may be current/successor)

### Contact
- **Email:** Contact through eckartsupply.com [GENERIC -- no public email found]
- **Phone:** Cincinnati location phone via website

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: eckartsupply.com has full ecommerce/online catalog ("Shop Online" for Cincinnati branch)
- Modern-looking website with location-specific pages
- Active Indeed employer page with job postings
- Has invested in digital -- more tech-mature than other prospects

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- **Growth pressure:** Expanded to 20 locations including Cincinnati -- rapid multi-state expansion often outpaces back-office systems
- **Leadership transition:** Mike Bennett has been with the company since 1969 and is CEO since 2002 -- succession planning is likely a concern

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Eckart is borderline on size (143-200 employees across 20 locations puts them above the 80-employee target). However, their Cincinnati branch may operate semi-independently and the company has the DNA of a small independent that grew. Mike Bennett literally started by stocking shelves in 1969. Their multi-category distribution (electrical + HVAC + plumbing + tools) across 20 locations means massive coordination complexity. Rated MED because they may be too large and already have more sophisticated systems (they have ecommerce). Consider targeting the Cincinnati branch manager specifically rather than HQ.

## RESEARCH NOTES

**Search Strategy Used:**
- Google: "electrical supply Cincinnati independent," "HVAC supply distributor Cincinnati OH," "lighting supply Cincinnati," "electrical distributor Cincinnati family owned," "wholesale electrical supply Hamilton Middletown Ohio," "electrical supply Northern Kentucky independent"
- BBB: Searched electrical supply and HVAC supply categories for Cincinnati, OH and Erlanger, KY
- Indeed/Glassdoor: Employer reviews for 2J Supply, Winstel Controls
- ZoomInfo/RocketReach: Key people and email formats
- Yellow Pages, Yelp, ThomasNet: Company profiles and reviews

**Market Observations:**
1. The Cincinnati electrical/HVAC distribution market is heavily consolidated. National chains (Graybar, CES, Wesco, Rexel/Platt) dominate. True independents are rare and tend to be small (under 25 employees).
2. HVAC distribution has more independents than electrical, with 2J Supply and Winstel Controls being the strongest prospects.
3. Northern Kentucky (Erlanger/Florence) is an underserved pocket with A&S Electric as the primary independent.
4. The Lebanon/Middletown corridor has Lebanon Electric/Middletown Electric filling a niche between Cincinnati and Dayton.
5. Most independents in this space lack ecommerce -- a significant competitive gap that Ops for Shops could address as part of a broader operational improvement conversation.

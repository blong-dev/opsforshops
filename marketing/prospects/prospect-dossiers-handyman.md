### Key People
- **Don Kennedy** -- Founder, Owner & President. Former Air Force officer and KC-135 pilot. Brought military values of integrity, service, and excellence to the home repair business. Has been running the company for 18+ years. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/tankerdon/. Email: don.kennedy@mastermylist.com
- **Adam Crowell** -- Professional Craftsman. BFA from University of Cincinnati. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/adam-crowell-a3a0a2140/
- **Office support staff referenced** in Glassdoor reviews ("Good office support") but no names publicly identified. This is a signal -- an unnamed office team likely means a thin back-office operation.

### Email Pattern
- don.kennedy@mastermylist.com (owner, confirmed from LinkedIn/website pattern)
- General inquiries via web form at mastermylist.com/contact-us/
- No generic info@ email publicly listed

### Pain Signals

**Customer Complaints -- Workmanship Quality Inconsistency at Scale:**
- Angi review: "Framing work was very poor, and drywall mudding was so poor the customer had to redo it themselves twice to get it acceptable enough." (Source: angi.com/companylist/us/oh/milford/promaster-home-repair-and-handyman-services-reviews-394120.htm)
- Another Angi review: "None of the framing was even close to square and had to completely redo the shower stall framing themselves." (Source: same)
- Billing error reported: customer charged $600 instead of $830 -- corrected when they called. (Source: same)
- These are classic quality control failures that occur when a growing company lacks standardized SOPs, checklists, and real-time crew oversight.

**Charge for Estimates Drives Negative Sentiment:**
- Multiple customers note a $79.00 charge for estimates, which creates friction. This suggests the company may lack an efficient estimating process and needs to charge for the time investment. (Source: Angi, BBB reviews)

**Active Hiring -- Growth/Turnover Pressure:**
- Careers page actively recruiting craftsmen: requires 10+ years experience, advertising $35+/hr ($4K-$9K/month). (Source: mastermylist.com/contact-us/careers/)
- Career path structure listed: Craftsman -> Project Lead -> Field Supervisor. This ladder suggests the company is actively trying to build organizational layers -- a sign of growth complexity.
- The demand for 10+ years experience at $35/hr signals difficulty filling positions with experienced tradespeople.

**Glassdoor Employee Reviews (8 reviews total):**
- Pros: "Pay is great with plenty of bonus incentives. Don, the owner, takes really good care of us." (Source: glassdoor.com/Reviews/Promaster-Home-Repair-Reviews-E803639.htm)
- Pros: "Good team of guys with good skills, good to work with. Good office support. Great company." (Source: same)
- Pros: "I love the flexibility of the job and the pay. I like that I have a lot of freedom to work my jobs the way I see it. I don't get micro-managed." (Source: same)
- Pros: "Plenty of work always coming in so you're never worrying if you'll have something to go do." (Source: same)
- Cons: Notably vague -- "none major enough to mention." Only 8 reviews total for an 18-year company is suspiciously low. Vague "cons" sections may indicate coached/filtered reviews.
- Key read-between-the-lines: "I don't get micro-managed" + "freedom to work my jobs the way I see it" = each craftsman is essentially autonomous. Combined with the quality complaints in customer reviews, this suggests a lack of standardized processes and oversight, which is exactly the kind of problem ops software solves.

**PR/Growth Milestones Signal Scaling:**
- Celebrated 4,000th customer in 2014 (8 years in). Press release: prweb.com/releases/promasterhomerepair/cincinnatioh/prweb11759433.htm
- Now approaching 20 years, serving both Cincinnati and NKY markets.
- Named by Expertise.com as one of Cincinnati's top handyman companies and top deck contractors for 2022.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Website:** WordPress (WP Rocket, Yoast SEO, MySQL, PHP). 64 technologies detected by BuiltWith.
- **Marketing:** Google Tag Manager, Open Graph, YouTube, Facebook, Shopify (likely for any e-commerce/merch)
- **Security:** HSTS enabled, Priority Hints
- **Online Scheduling:** Website has an "Online Scheduling Cincinnati" page at mastermylist.com/contact-us/online-scheduling-cincinnati/ -- suggests they have some form of booking, but unclear if it's a full FSM platform or just a simple form/calendar embed.
- **No visible evidence of:** ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber, or any dedicated Field Service Management (FSM) software.
- **Assessment:** Moderate tech adoption for marketing and web presence. The website is content-heavy and SEO-optimized (Yoast). But back-office and field operations tech is unclear. The quality control issues and autonomous craftsman model suggest scheduling, dispatch, and QA are not systematized with modern FSM tools.

### Why They're a Good Prospect
ProMaster is the largest independent handyman company in the Cincinnati market with ~$3.8M revenue, 15-20 employees, and an 18-year track record. Owner Don Kennedy is a military veteran who values systems and processes (his website messaging is all about reliability and on-time guarantees), but the customer reviews reveal a gap between the brand promise and the field execution. Quality complaints about framing and drywall, combined with employee reviews praising "freedom" and lack of micro-management, paint a picture of a company where the owner's standards aren't consistently reaching the crew level. They're actively hiring and building organizational layers (Craftsman -> Project Lead -> Field Supervisor), which means they're at an inflection point where manual management is breaking down. Don Kennedy is the Reluctant Operator -- he built the brand on military precision but doesn't have the operational technology to enforce it at scale.

## PROSPECT 2: Handy Home Guys LLC
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Handy Home Guys, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.handyhomeguys.com
- **Phone:** (513) 322-5780
- **Email:** Not publicly listed. Contact via web form at handyhomeguys.com/contact-us
- **Location:** 6908 Cambridge Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45227 (Terrace Park, OH 45174 also listed)
- **Founded:** December 24, 2012 (12+ years in business)
- **Employees:** 11-50 (Source: ZoomInfo, Wiza, SignalHire estimates)
- **Revenue:** $100K-$5M range (Source: ZoomInfo -- wide range suggests limited data; likely $1M-$3M based on employee count and service breadth)
- **Service Area:** Greater Cincinnati OH neighborhoods
- **Services:** Remodeling, renovation, plumbing, landscaping, construction, gutter cleaning, deck building, yard work, general handyman
- **BBB:** File opened 9/27/2016. NOT BBB Accredited. (Source: bbb.org/us/oh/terrace-park/profile/home-improvement/handy-home-guys-0292-90040865)

### Key People
- **Justin Fay** -- Co-Owner
- **Cebastian Hilton** -- Co-Owner / CEO
- **Ben** -- Field crew member (named in multiple customer reviews as punctual and professional)
- No office manager or operations manager publicly identified.

### Email Pattern
- No public email found. Contact via web form or phone only.
- LinkedIn company page: linkedin.com/company/handy-home-guys
- ZoomInfo profile: zoominfo.com/c/handy-home-guys-llc/358935645

### Pain Signals

**Follow-Up / Communication Issues -- Classic Scaling Pain:**
- Angi review: "Seemed busy and had a little trouble with follow up." (Source: angi.com/companylist/us/oh/terrace-park/handy-home-guys-reviews-7754722.htm)
- This is the #1 pain signal. A company described as "busy" with "trouble with follow up" is a company whose incoming demand has outpaced its ability to manage customer communication. This is exactly the problem CRM/scheduling software solves.

**Not BBB Accredited After 12 Years:**
- Despite operating since 2012 and having a BBB file since 2016, the company has not pursued or maintained BBB accreditation. This signals either (a) lack of admin bandwidth to manage third-party credentialing, or (b) deliberate deprioritization of back-office tasks in favor of field work.

**Multi-Owner Structure Attempting to Professionalize:**
- Two co-owners (Justin Fay and Cebastian Hilton), with Hilton listed as "CEO." The CEO title on a handyman company of this size (11-50 employees) signals aspiration to professionalize beyond a typical trades business. They are trying to build a real company, not just run a crew.
- Workers described as "full-time, year-round employees" -- this is a W-2 model that creates payroll, scheduling, benefits, and HR complexity that a 1099-subcontractor model avoids.

**Extremely Broad Service Mix = Operational Complexity:**
- Services span: remodeling, renovation, plumbing, landscaping, construction, gutter cleaning, deck building, yard work.
- Managing this breadth with 11-50 employees requires sophisticated scheduling to match the right skills to the right jobs. Without FSM software, this is done via phone calls, texts, and the owners' personal knowledge of who can do what.

**Growing Local Reputation Creating More Demand:**
- Neighborhood Favorite on Nextdoor in 2022 and 2023. (Source: nextdoor.com/pages/all-around-joe-llc-milford-oh/)
- 5/5 on Houzz, 4.9/5 on Angi. (Source: houzz.com, angi.com)
- Strong word-of-mouth reputation means increasing inbound demand, which amplifies the follow-up problem.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Website:** WordPress.org, PHP
- **Marketing:** Facebook Pixel, Facebook Web Custom Audiences
- **No online booking or customer portal visible**
- **No evidence of FSM software** (ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber, etc.)
- **Assessment:** Basic WordPress site with Facebook ads for lead gen. No operational technology visible. Likely managing scheduling manually -- phone calls, texts, maybe a shared Google Calendar or whiteboard.

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Handy Home Guys is a 12-year-old company in the sweet spot (11-50 employees) with two co-owners actively trying to professionalize (one has the CEO title). They have a strong local reputation driving increasing demand, but their own customers are noticing they "have trouble with follow up." The W-2 employee model, broad service mix, and absence of any visible operational technology means they are managing complexity with manual tools. The CEO aspiration combined with execution gaps is the textbook Ops for Shops customer -- they want to be a real company, they just don't have the systems yet.

## PROSPECT 3: All Around Joe LLC
**Priority: 2-MEDIUM**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** All Around Joe, LLC
- **Website:** https://myallaroundjoe.net/
- **Phone:** (513) 348-6577
- **Email:** Not publicly listed. Contact via web form at myallaroundjoe.net/contact/
- **Location:** 5946 Woodspoint Dr, Milford, OH 45150
- **Founded:** February 9, 1996 (incorporated December 10, 2010). 30 years in business.
- **Employees:** ~5-15 estimated. BBB lists "1 employee" at registered address, but customer reviews reference multiple named staff (Dave, Moe, Mike, John, Brandon) plus an office coordinator (Rita). Website has a dedicated Team page.
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available. Estimated $500K-$2M based on longevity, award volume, and multi-person crew.
- **Service Area:** Milford, Greater Cincinnati OH, surrounding suburbs
- **Services:** Home maintenance, handyman services, remodeling, construction
- **BBB:** Accredited since 3/14/2011, A+ rated. BBB Torch Award winner. (Source: bbb.org/us/oh/milford/profile/construction-services/all-around-joe-llc-0292-90006034)

### Key People
- **Lawrence Joseph ("Joe") Wood** -- Owner/Operator. Has been running the business since 1996 (30 years). LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/joe-wood-7ab29659/ (213 connections)
- **Rita** -- Office coordinator / appointment scheduler (referenced by name in customer reviews, appears to be the sole back-office person)
- **Field crew:** Dave, Moe, Mike, John, Brandon (names referenced in various customer reviews over multiple years)

### Email Pattern
- No public email found. Web form and phone only.
- Rita handles phone scheduling and customer communication.

### Pain Signals

**30-Year Business With No Systemization:**
- Founded in 1996 and still run by the founding owner as "Owner/Operator." No apparent middle management layer between Joe and the field crew beyond Rita. This is a business that has never fully systemized its operations despite three decades of experience.

**Reactive Fire-Drill Culture:**
- Customer review on Angi: "Rita apologized and sent repairmen within 2 hours the same day and resolved the problem at no extra charge!" (Source: angi.com/companylist/us/oh/milford/all-around-joe-llc-reviews-6194770.htm)
- This quote, presented positively by the customer, actually reveals a reactive operational model. Rita is doing damage control -- apologizing and dispatching emergency fixes. The company's service recovery is excellent (and the customer was happy), but the need for service recovery at all suggests upstream scheduling or quality control issues.

**Award-Driven But No Growth Signals:**
- BBB Torch Award winner. Angi Super Service Awards in 5-8 categories for 5+ consecutive years. All A+ ratings.
- Despite 30 years in business and a trophy case of awards, there is no evidence of: expansion, new service lines, new locations, leadership hires, or operational investment.
- This is a lifestyle business that has plateaued operationally. The owner may not be seeking growth, which means the pitch must focus on reducing Joe's personal burden rather than scaling.

**No Indeed/Glassdoor Employer Reviews:**
- Zero employer reviews found on Indeed or Glassdoor despite 30 years in operation and multiple crew members. This suggests the business has never invested in employer branding or recruiting beyond personal networks.

**Succession Question:**
- Joe has been running this business since 1996 -- that's 30 years. No co-owner, no apparent successor, no management layer. The succession/exit question looms large.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Website:** Appears WordPress-based (standard blog structure, pages). Functional but dated design.
- **No online booking or scheduling portal.**
- **No customer portal.**
- **No evidence of FSM software.**
- **Contact is web form + phone only.**
- **Assessment:** Very low tech adoption. This business runs on phone calls, Rita's personal knowledge, and likely a paper or basic spreadsheet schedule. The website is a brochure, not a tool.

### Why They're a Good Prospect
All Around Joe is the quintessential Reluctant Operator prospect. Joe Wood built an award-winning, 30-year business on personal craftsmanship and reputation, but the operation still revolves around him and a single office coordinator (Rita). The gap between their award-winning reputation and their operational infrastructure is enormous. The pitch here isn't about growth -- it's about making Joe's life easier and reducing the personal burden that comes from being the single point of failure in a 30-year business. If Joe ever wants to step back, sell, or retire, the business needs to be able to run without him -- and right now it can't.

## PROSPECT 4: Affordable Home Repair Co.
**Priority: 1-HIGH (strongest operational pain signals)**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Affordable Home Repair Co.
- **Website:** https://www.affordablehomerepairco.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 344-0539 (also listed as (513) 766-7571)
- **Email:** Not publicly listed. Contact via web form at affordablehomerepairco.com/contact-us
- **Location:** 10165 Snowflake Ln, Cincinnati, OH 45251
- **Founded:** ~1990 (35+ years in business per website and BBB claims of "30 plus years of experience")
- **Employees:** Not publicly available. Described as "family-owned and operated" with "Jack and crew," suggesting a small team of 3-10.
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available.
- **Service Area:** Greater Cincinnati OH
- **Services:** Bathroom remodeling, carpentry, ceramic tile, decks, drywall, electrical, fences, general home maintenance, winterizing, kitchen remodeling, lighting, ceiling fans, painting, plumbing, siding, remodeling, windows, doors
- **BBB:** Accredited since 1/20/2016 (Source: bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/construction-services/affordable-home-repair-co-0292-16000204)

### Key People
- **Jack Edwards** -- Owner. Runs the business personally. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/jack-edwards-0750a0109
- No other staff publicly named. "Jack and crew" is how the business is described in reviews.

### Email Pattern
- No public email found. Web form and phone only.
- Jack Edwards likely manages all customer communication personally.

### Pain Signals

**CRITICAL: Owner Forgetting Appointments and Screening Calls:**
- Customer review: "Jack completely forgot about an appointment, never showed for a rescheduled visit and was screening calls." The reviewer concluded: "Jack is unreliable and lacks professional communication skills." (Source: angi.com/companylist/us/oh/cincinnati/affordable-home-repair-co-reviews-94109.htm)
- This is the single strongest pain signal in the entire handyman prospect list. The owner himself is forgetting appointments and then avoiding the customer. This is what happens when a sole operator manages scheduling in his head or on scraps of paper.

**No-Show Pattern:**
- Another review: After finishing one project, "the contractor said he would return for a garbage disposal installation but never showed up, and didn't have receipts from the previous work." (Source: same)
- Pattern of no-shows + no receipts = no scheduling system, no invoicing system, no follow-up system.

**Mixed Overall Rating Confirms Operational Issues:**
- Rated 3.0 out of 5 on Angi (very low for the industry -- most handyman companies with any reviews at all are 4.0+).
- The split is telling: customers who DO get service praise the quality and price: "Jack and crew work quickly and efficiently" and "came in less than half the price of competitors." (Source: same)
- The problem isn't the work itself -- it's the operations around the work (scheduling, follow-up, invoicing, communication).

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Website:** Basic template site (likely Wix or similar website builder). Clean but very minimal.
- **No online booking.**
- **No customer portal.**
- **No FSM software visible.**
- **No social media presence detected.**
- **Assessment:** Lowest tech profile of any qualified prospect. This business runs entirely on phone calls and the owner's personal memory. The forgotten appointments prove this model has broken down.

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Affordable Home Repair is the most painful prospect on this list -- and the most compelling case study if we can help them. Jack Edwards has 35 years of experience and customers praise his work quality and pricing, but his operations are literally falling apart. He's forgetting appointments, screening calls from frustrated customers, not providing receipts, and carrying a 3.0 Angi rating because of it. The work is good; the business infrastructure is nonexistent. This is a company that could transform its reputation and revenue with basic scheduling, CRM, and invoicing tools. The risk: Jack may be too set in his ways to adopt new systems, or the business may be too small (3-10 employees) to justify the investment. But the pain is undeniable and documented.

## PROSPECT 5: CheckMark Pros (Checkmark Handyman Services LLC)
**Priority: 2-MEDIUM**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Checkmark Handyman Services, LLC (d/b/a CheckMark Pros)
- **Website:** https://checkmarkpros.com/
- **Phone:** Not publicly listed on website (contact via web form)
- **Email:** Not publicly listed. Contact via website.
- **Location:** 1684 Petersburg Road, Hebron, KY 41048
- **Founded:** ~2018-2019 (estimated from PPP loan data and general timeline; 6-7 years in business)
- **Employees:** Small but growing. PPP loan in April 2020 was only $5,693 (suggesting 1-3 employees at that time). Careers page now lists Helper, Pro, Lead Pro, and Manager roles -- indicating expansion. (Source: federalpay.org/paycheck-protection-program/checkmark-handyman-services-llc-hebron-ky)
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available. KC Cochran references prior experience developing processes for "a rapidly growing $2M company" (unclear if this refers to CheckMark's current revenue or a prior employer). (Source: Handyman Marketing Pros podcast)
- **Service Area:** Northern Kentucky -- Hebron, Francisville, Florence, Burlington, Union, and surrounding areas
- **Services:** Handyman, house cleaning, remodeling (dedicated Remodel Division)
- **BBB:** NOT BBB Accredited

### Key People
- **K.C. Cochran** -- Founder & Principal Owner. Former chief operations officer who left corporate to start CheckMark. Manages the business remotely while traveling for ministry work. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/k-c-cochran-3426149 (Source: Handyman Marketing Pros podcast #39, LinkedIn)
- No other staff publicly named.

### Email Pattern
- No public email found. Contact via website only.
- KC Cochran's LinkedIn may be used for direct outreach.

### Pain Signals

**CRITICAL: Owner Manages Business REMOTELY:**
- Per the Handyman Marketing Pros podcast interview (#39): KC "manages the business remotely while traveling around the country doing ministry work and caring for friends and family." (Source: handymanmarketingpros.com/39-checkmark-pros/)
- This is a massive operational pain signal. A growing handyman company with field crews and multiple service divisions is being managed by an owner who is frequently not in the local market. This model requires robust systems, communication tools, and delegation frameworks -- or it breaks.

**Rapid Expansion From Solo to Multi-Division:**
- Started from "his family minivan, equipped with only a few tools" and has since built: (1) a handyman division, (2) a house cleaning division, and (3) a dedicated Remodel Division.
- Structured career tiers: Helper -> Pro -> Lead Pro -> Manager.
- Managing three distinct service divisions with a growing team while the owner is remote creates enormous operational complexity.

**Uses Markate -- A Budget FSM Tool:**
- Listed on Markate.com (markate.com/business/checkmark), a basic job management and invoicing platform for small contractors. (Source: Markate profile)
- Markate is a starter tool that lacks the depth of Housecall Pro, Jobber, or ServiceTitan. As CheckMark scales into multi-division operations, Markate's limitations will become a bottleneck.

**Hiring Challenges:**
- Careers page describes searching for people who "share his commitment to customer service." (Source: checkmarkpros.com/careers/)
- The emphasis on finding people who share values (rather than specific skills) suggests difficulty finding and retaining workers who meet KC's standards.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Scheduling/CRM:** Uses Markate (basic FSM tool for small businesses -- job management, invoicing, scheduling).
- **Website:** Custom-built appearance, not obviously WordPress. Clean and professional.
- **Assessment:** CheckMark is further along the technology adoption curve than most prospects on this list (they at least use Markate). The opportunity is that Markate is a starter tool they will likely outgrow as the business scales, especially with multi-division operations and a remote owner.

### Why They're a Good Prospect
CheckMark Pros is an interesting case: a former corporate COO who started a handyman company and is applying corporate thinking (career ladders, multi-division structure, process-driven hiring) to a trades business -- but managing it remotely while traveling for ministry work. The remote management model is a ticking time bomb for quality and customer satisfaction as the company scales. They already use Markate (so they're not anti-technology), but Markate is a budget tool that won't support multi-division operations at scale. The pitch to KC is about leveling up his systems to match his ambition -- he thinks like an operator, he just needs better tools. The risk: the company may still be too small (under 5 employees) and KC's remote/part-time attention may limit growth.

## PROSPECT 6: Family Handyman & Remodeling Services LLC
**Priority: 3-WATCH LIST**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Family Handyman & Remodeling Services LLC
- **Website:** https://fhmrservices.com/
- **Phone:** Listed on website (not captured in search results -- needs manual verification)
- **Address:** 8630 Brookridge Dr, West Chester, OH
- **Founded:** Exact date unknown. Appears 5+ years based on Yelp presence (updated August 2025) and review history.
- **Employees:** Not publicly available. Website language ("our team," "our professionals") suggests a small crew of 3-10.
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available.
- **Service Area:** West Chester, northern Cincinnati suburbs
- **Services:** Carpentry, drywall, electrical, fence repair, flooring, gutter cleaning, painting, plumbing, house washing, door repair/replacement, cabinet repair/installation/refinishing
- **BBB:** No BBB profile found
- **Yelp:** 28 photos, listed as General Contractors in West Chester (Source: yelp.com/biz/family-handyman-and-remodeling-services-west-chester)

### Key People
- Owner name NOT publicly found in any search. This is a significant data gap.
- No staff names publicly listed.

### Email Pattern
- No public email found. Web form and phone only.

### Pain Signals

**No BBB Presence At All:**
- No BBB profile found. For a company operating 5+ years in a market where competitors are BBB accredited, this signals either administrative neglect or deliberate avoidance of credentialing processes. Either way, it points to thin back-office capacity.

**Broad Service Scope for Apparent Small Team:**
- Offering carpentry, drywall, electrical, fence repair, flooring, gutter cleaning, painting, plumbing, house washing, door repair, and cabinet work from what appears to be a small crew creates significant scheduling complexity.

**Marketing Outpaces Operations:**
- Website is polished with professional branding ("5 Star Rated, Licensed & Insured, Free Estimates, 1-Year Labor Warranty").
- But: no online booking, no customer portal, no scheduling tool visible.
- The gap between marketing sophistication and operational tooling is a classic signal of a company that has invested in getting leads but not in managing them.

**West Chester / Northern Cincinnati Positioning:**
- Located in the high-growth suburban corridor north of Cincinnati, which has both new construction and aging housing stock. Demand is likely strong and growing.

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Website:** Professionally designed (possibly Squarespace or similar modern builder). Clean branding.
- **No evidence of FSM software, online booking, or customer portal.**
- **Assessment:** Good marketing shell, likely no back-office systems. Lowest data availability of any prospect on this list.

### Why They're a Watch List Prospect
Family Handyman & Remodeling Services checks some boxes (independent, local, broad services, apparent small team) but has significant data gaps: unknown owner, unknown founding date, unknown employee count, and no BBB presence. The polished website suggests ambition, and the West Chester location is a strong market, but without being able to identify the decision-maker, outreach is challenging. Recommend a phone call to the business to gather basic qualifying information before investing in a full outreach sequence.

- **Size:** 201-500 employees across ~70 franchise units
- **Local Franchise (Blue Ash):** Independently owned, NOT BBB Accredited. Shares office space with corporate.
- **Local Franchise (Butler Warren):** BBB Accredited since 8/25/2010, 17 years in business.
- **BBB Corporate Rating:** B- (failure to respond to 1 complaint)
- **Customer Complaints:** "HORRIBLE QUALITY & WORKMANSHIP" on bathroom renovation; contractor showed up only half the time, was an hour late, left two hours early. Paid $6,000+ for incomplete work. "Sloppy work grouting." (Source: bbb.org, Yelp)
- **Indeed Employee Reviews (83 total):** "The business did not have enough employees for the workload." One employee: "lied to when I was hired" about pay; advised future employees to "get promises about pay in writing." Another: "the new owners have no idea what they are doing" with "unrealistic expectations." (Source: indeed.com/cmp/Handyman-Connection/reviews)
- **Glassdoor Reviews (64 total, 3.7/5 stars):** "It is a job that did not pay only cost me money." Don't "get paid for use of own vehicle or gas." (Source: glassdoor.com/Reviews/Handyman-Connection-Cincinnati-Reviews)
- **Pain Signal Notes:** The local Blue Ash and Butler Warren franchises DO show significant operational pain (staffing issues, quality complaints, employee dissatisfaction). However, as a franchise system, the local operators would need to work within Handyman Connection's corporate technology ecosystem. Not a good independent prospect.
- **Why Excluded:** National franchise. Corporate HQ in Cincinnati but operational decisions are franchise-system-wide.

- **Founded:** 2011

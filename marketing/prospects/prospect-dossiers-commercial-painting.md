(Source: leachpaintingcontractors.com, Procore)

### Service Area
Cincinnati tri-state area including Mason, OH; Covington, KY; and surrounding communities. Has a second Yelp listing under Covington, KY address, suggesting cross-river work.

### Key People
- **La Leach** -- President & Co-Owner. Email: l***@leachpaintingcontractors.com (ZoomInfo, partially masked). INFERRED: la@leachpaintingcontractors.com or lleach@leachpaintingcontractors.com. Phone on file at ZoomInfo.
- **Mark Leach** -- Co-Owner. No email found publicly. Likely follows same @leachpaintingcontractors.com domain pattern.
- **Elani Leach** -- Office Manager. Email: e***@leachpaintingcontractors.com (ZoomInfo, partially masked). INFERRED: elani@leachpaintingcontractors.com. This is the "Backbone" persona -- the person managing daily operations, scheduling, and communications for a commercial painting sub.
- **Kevin McClanahan** -- Senior Estimator & Project Manager. Email: k***@leachpaintingcontractors.com (ZoomInfo). INFERRED: kevin@leachpaintingcontractors.com or kmcclanahan@leachpaintingcontractors.com.
- **Andrew Bronner** -- Senior Field Superintendent. Email: a***@leachpaintingcontractors.com (ZoomInfo). INFERRED: andrew@leachpaintingcontractors.com or abronner@leachpaintingcontractors.com.

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @leachpaintingcontractors.com
- Pattern appears to be firstname@leachpaintingcontractors.com based on the partial reveals from ZoomInfo
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- call (513) 701-9030 to verify before sending cold email
- Email domain pattern: first-name basis (informal, family business)

### Pain Signals

**Expired Contractor License (BuildZoom):**
Painter license CBRC008552 expired 09-05-2025 and has not been renewed as of February 2026. For a commercial painting sub that works with GCs, an expired license is a serious operational gap -- GCs check this, and it can disqualify them from bidding on projects. This suggests either administrative overwhelm (nobody tracking renewals) or deliberate cost-cutting. Either way, it signals weak back-office processes.

**No Public Reviews Despite 90+ Year History:**
BuildZoom: "hasn't received any reviews." Yelp: no reviews on either the Mason or Covington listings. Google reviews: minimal. For a four-generation painting company, this is unusual and suggests no systematic approach to reputation management or customer follow-up.

**Not BBB Accredited:**
Despite four generations and nearly a century of family painting history, the company has never sought BBB accreditation. Combined with the expired license and zero reviews, this paints a picture of a company that does good work through GC relationships but has no back-office infrastructure for marketing, compliance tracking, or reputation management.

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: WordPress.org with reCAPTCHA, PHP, Cloudflare CDN (Source: ZoomInfo)
- Listed on Procore construction network (passive profile, not necessarily using Procore for project management)
- No CRM, scheduling, or project management software identified
- No customer portal or online booking
- No estimating software visible
- Website is professional but template-based -- likely built by an outside vendor, not maintained in-house
- No evidence of any construction management software (no PlanGrid, Buildertrend, Procore paid, etc.)

### Why This is a Top Prospect
Leach Painting is a four-generation family commercial painting business with 11-25 employees that works as a sub for GCs on commercial and industrial projects -- exactly the profile that needs operational help but can't justify (and wouldn't know how to hire) a dedicated IT or ops person. The expired contractor license is a flashing red signal that administrative processes are falling through the cracks. The Office Manager (Elani Leach, likely a family member) is the Backbone persona managing everything from scheduling to compliance to bid coordination, and she's clearly stretched thin. Zero public reviews after 90 years, no BBB accreditation, and minimal digital presence beyond a template WordPress site all point to a company that wins work through relationships and craftsmanship, not systems. The fact that they have a Senior Estimator/PM and a Senior Field Superintendent suggests they're big enough to have operational complexity but not big enough to have operations infrastructure.

## PROSPECT 2: Lehn Painting Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Lehn Painting Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.lehnpainting.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 732-1515
- **Email:** See Key People below
- **Location (HQ):** 4175 Taylor Rd, Batavia, OH 45103
- **Founded:** 1986 (40 years in business) -- some sources say 1996, but company states "since 1986" on their website
- **Employees:** ~46 employees (Manta); ZoomInfo/LinkedIn says 11-50
- **Revenue:** ~$3.9M (Manta)
- **BBB Status:** NOT BBB Accredited; BBB states "insufficient information to issue a rating" (Source: https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/batavia/profile/painting-contractors/lehn-painting-inc-0292-1194158)
- **BuildZoom Score:** 99 -- ranks in top 15% of 52,717 Ohio licensed contractors
- **FMCSA/DOT:** Registered as motor carrier (SAFER Web DOT #3049945) -- operates company vehicles/fleet

### Services
Commercial and industrial painting, epoxy floor coatings, sandblasting, restoration services, protective wall paneling, zolatone, polymix, multispec, commercial wall covering, acoustic panels. Serves schools, hospitals, showrooms, commercial facilities, and industrial sites. Also does high-performance coatings. (Source: lehnpainting.com)

### Service Area
Cincinnati tri-state area: Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. Based in Batavia, OH (Clermont County, east side of Cincinnati metro).

### Key People
- **William R. Lehn** -- President (BBB listing). Founder/patriarch of the family business.
- **David Lehn** -- Key employee (ZoomInfo). Likely son/family member in operations or leadership role. Title not confirmed but listed as key personnel.
- **Nicholas Collins** -- Project Manager & Estimator. Email: ****@lehnpainting.com (ZoomInfo, partially masked). Published contact email on Blue Book ProView: ncollins@lehnpainting.com. Confidence: **CONFIRMED** (from ProView/Blue Book listing).
- **Daryl Smith** -- Project Manager. No email found publicly.
- **Kendra Corsmeier** -- HR/Payroll Administrator. Email: k***@lehnpainting.com (ZoomInfo). INFERRED: kcorsmeier@lehnpainting.com or kendra@lehnpainting.com. This is a Backbone persona -- handling HR and payroll for ~46 employees.
- **Connie Hay** -- Payroll Administrator & Duties Receiver. A second payroll/admin person suggests the back-office workload is heavy enough to need two people on it -- but likely without adequate systems.

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @lehnpainting.com
- Pattern: first-initial + last name @lehnpainting.com (based on ncollins@lehnpainting.com confirmed)
- Confidence: **HIGH** -- ncollins confirmed; others follow same pattern
- INFERRED: wlehn@lehnpainting.com (William Lehn), dlehn@lehnpainting.com (David Lehn), dsmith@lehnpainting.com (Daryl Smith), chay@lehnpainting.com (Connie Hay)

### Pain Signals

**Customer Property Damage Incident (Google/Review Sites):**
> **"While the company was painting for a college on a windy day, they got paint all over a customer's newly bought truck causing over $5,000 in damage, and their insurance wouldn't cover the full amount for the mistake."**
-- Customer review (Source: review aggregation sites)

This incident signals: (1) inadequate job-site risk management/weather protocols, (2) insurance coverage gaps (their policy didn't fully cover the claim), and (3) a communication/resolution failure that escalated to a public complaint. For a 46-employee company doing institutional work (colleges), this is the kind of incident that proper operational procedures and job-site checklists would prevent.

**Two Payroll/Admin Staff But No Ops Manager Title:**
The company has ~46 employees, two payroll administrators (Kendra Corsmeier and Connie Hay), but no visible Operations Manager, Dispatcher, or Scheduling Coordinator. The project managers (Nicholas Collins, Daryl Smith) likely handle their own scheduling and crew coordination, meaning operational knowledge is fragmented across individual PMs rather than centralized.

**Not BBB Accredited -- "Insufficient Information":**
BBB explicitly states they don't have enough information to rate the company, despite it being in business since 1986 with ~46 employees. This suggests the company has never engaged with BBB, has no systematic complaint resolution process, and operates entirely on GC relationships and word-of-mouth.

**DOT/Fleet Registration:**
FMCSA registration (DOT #3049945) means they operate commercial vehicles -- adding fleet management, DOT compliance, vehicle maintenance tracking, and driver qualification files to the administrative burden. For a painting company without visible operations software, this fleet compliance layer is likely managed with spreadsheets or paper.

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: Uses Yoast (WordPress SEO plugin), jQuery Migrate -- WordPress site
- **Microsoft Exchange Online** -- for email (not Gmail/Outlook.com, but not a modern cloud suite either)
- **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central** -- this is significant. D365 BC is an ERP/accounting system. If they're actually using it, it suggests someone attempted to modernize their financial/operations stack. However, D365 BC for a 46-person painting company is unusual and potentially over-engineered -- it may be underutilized, poorly configured, or only used for accounting while everything else stays manual.
- Google Font API (standard website component)
- No construction management software visible (no Procore, PlanGrid, Buildertrend)
- No CRM or customer portal
- Careers page exists but is basic -- no ATS (applicant tracking system)

### Why This is a Top Prospect
Lehn Painting is the largest and most operationally complex prospect on this list: ~46 employees, ~$3.9M revenue, fleet vehicles with DOT registration, commercial/industrial work across three states, and services spanning painting, epoxy, sandblasting, and restoration. They have enough organizational complexity (multiple PMs, two payroll admins, field crews, fleet) to genuinely need operational systems, but their tech stack suggests a gap between ambition and execution -- Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central for accounting/ERP alongside zero construction management, scheduling, or CRM tools. The property damage incident at a college job reveals gaps in field operations protocols. Two payroll admins but no Operations Manager title suggests the back-office is handling volume but not strategy. William Lehn (President, founder) is the Reluctant Operator who built a successful 40-year business on craft, and someone in the next generation (likely David Lehn) may be the champion for modernization. Nicholas Collins (PM/Estimator) at ncollins@lehnpainting.com is a confirmed contact and a good initial touchpoint as someone who lives in the gap between field work and office systems every day.

- **Email:** info@hyblastinc.com (CONFIRMED from website)

### Key People
- **Robert "Bob" Cunningham** -- President / Co-Owner. Second generation. LinkedIn: "40 years experience in the Abrasive blasting/Painting industry." Bob, Tom, and Don Cunningham (three sons of founders Bill and Betty) developed the business into what it is today.
- **Nic Cunningham** -- Vice President / Operations Manager. Third generation, joined in 2013. LinkedIn title: "Operations Manager." Email: n***@hyblastinc.com (ZoomInfo).

- **Don Cunningham** -- Co-Owner. One of the three Cunningham brothers. No public contact info.
- **No Office Manager or Administrative Staff identified.** For a 16-person industrial services company with specialized coating work requiring safety compliance, material tracking, and project coordination, the absence of any visible admin staff is a critical signal.

### Email Pattern

- Generic: info@hyblastinc.com (CONFIRMED from website contact page)
- INFERRED personal: nic@hyblastinc.com (Nic Cunningham, VP); bob@hyblastinc.com (Bob Cunningham, President)

### Pain Signals

**Glassdoor Employee Safety Concern:**
> **"Stay focus on employee safety."**
-- Glassdoor employee review, advice to management (Source: https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/HY-BLAST-Middletown-Reviews-EI_IE834745.0,8_IL.9,19_IC1145731.htm)

For an industrial sandblasting and coatings company, employee safety is not just an HR issue -- it's an OSHA compliance and liability issue. Silica dust exposure, confined space entry, chemical coatings handling, and abrasive blasting all carry serious regulatory requirements. An employee publicly stating management needs to "stay focus on employee safety" suggests gaps in safety protocols, documentation, or enforcement.

**Low Starting Wages / Working Interview Practice (Glassdoor):**
> **"Hired through a working interview at $12.00/hour, followed by a three-month contract at $16.00/hour, then second shift work at $17.00/hour."**
-- Glassdoor interview review (Source: Glassdoor)

$12/hour for a working interview in industrial sandblasting is below market for skilled trades. The three-tier pay structure (working interview > 3-month contract > regular employment) suggests difficulty retaining employees and a revolving-door hiring process that creates constant onboarding overhead. For 16 employees, even modest turnover creates significant operational disruption.

**No Visible Administrative Staff:**
A 49-year-old industrial services company with 16 employees, specialized safety compliance requirements (OSHA silica rules, confined space, hazmat), and both shop work and field work -- with zero visible office/admin staff. Bob Cunningham (President, 40+ years in the industry) and Nic Cunningham (VP/Ops Manager, since 2013) are likely handling all administrative functions themselves: quoting, scheduling, safety documentation, invoicing, fleet/equipment management, and employee records.

**Minimal Digital Presence:**
- No public reviews on Yellow Pages ("Be the first to review")
- No Yelp reviews
- No Google review presence
- No BBB profile
- Website is functional but basic -- no online quoting, no customer portal, no project gallery beyond a few photos
- For a 49-year-old company, the digital absence suggests all business comes through industrial/commercial relationships and referrals, with zero marketing infrastructure

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website: Basic HTML/CSS site, not WordPress -- appears to be a simple custom-built or template site
- info@hyblastinc.com -- generic email, likely goes to Bob or Nic directly
- No CRM, scheduling, or project management software visible
- No safety management software visible (critical gap for sandblasting/industrial coatings)
- No estimating or quoting tools visible
- No customer portal or online inquiry system beyond basic contact form
- No social media presence identified
- Chamber of Commerce membership suggests networking-based business development, not digital marketing

### Why This is a Top Prospect
Hy-Blast is a textbook family-trade industrial services company in generational transition. Founded in 1977 by Bill and Betty Cunningham, now run by their three sons (Bob as President, 40+ years in the industry) with the third generation (Nic Cunningham, VP/Ops Manager since 2013) beginning to take over. This is the classic moment when the next-gen leader recognizes that "the way we've always done it" won't scale or survive -- but doesn't know where to start modernizing. The company has 16 employees doing hazardous industrial work (sandblasting, chemical coatings) with no visible administrative staff, no safety management software, no CRM, no scheduling tools, and an employee publicly flagging safety concerns on Glassdoor. The below-market wages and three-tier hiring process suggest retention problems that create a constant drag on productivity. Nic Cunningham is the ideal contact -- he's the third-generation VP/Ops Manager who likely feels the operational pain most acutely and has the positional authority to bring in outside help.

## PROSPECT 4: Epoxy Systems Blasting & Coating Inc.
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Epoxy Systems Blasting & Coating Inc. (also operates as Epoxy Systems International Inc.)

- **Phone:** (513) 924-1800
- **Fax:** (513) 924-1900 (having a fax number in 2026 is a notable tech signal)
- **Email:** See Key People below
- **Location (HQ):** 5640 Morgan Road, Cleves, OH 45002 (two facilities at this address)
- **Founded:** Started operations ~1978; incorporated 7/2/1997 (BBB). Over 20 years in operation per website; owner Ray Litmer has 35+ years in the coatings field.
- **Employees:** 11-50 (ZoomInfo)
- **Revenue:** <$5M (ZoomInfo)
- **BBB Status:** NOT BBB Accredited (Source: https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/cleves/profile/concrete-restoration/epoxy-systems-international-inc-0292-90004220)

### Services
Advanced abrasive blasting, industrial painting, powder coating. Work ranges from small custom steel and aluminum parts to large fabricated steel structures up to 30,000 lbs -- beams, columns, angles, channel, plate, tanks, machinery, pipe, and fittings. Epoxy flooring (residential and commercial). All work performed at their two facilities in Cleves, OH. Also does field/travel work. (Source: epoxy-systems-blast-powder-paint.com)

### Service Area
Cincinnati tri-state area and across the United States (for travel/field work). Based in Cleves, OH (western Hamilton County, near the Indiana border).

### Key People
- **Steve Ferneding** -- President (BBB listing). Senior leadership of the overall operation.
- **Ray Litmer** -- Owner / Co-Founder / General Manager. Responsible for day-to-day operations of both the powder coating and painting shops. 35+ years in the coatings field. Has previously owned a painting contracting company, a coating distributorship, and worked as a technical rep for major coatings manufacturers. LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ray-litmer-02584b23
- **Julie Ott** -- Office Manager. Email: j***@epoxy-systems.com (ZoomInfo). INFERRED: jott@epoxy-systems.com or julie@epoxy-systems.com. This is the Backbone persona -- managing the office for two facilities, two divisions, and 11-50 employees.

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @epoxy-systems.com (flooring division) and likely @epoxysystems-bc.com (blasting & coating division, per ZoomInfo partial reveal for Ray Litmer: r***@epoxysystems-bc.com)
- Two separate email domains for two divisions of the same company = fragmented communication infrastructure
- INFERRED: rlitmer@epoxysystems-bc.com (Ray Litmer), jott@epoxy-systems.com (Julie Ott)
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- call (513) 924-1800 to verify

### Pain Signals

**Indeed Employee Review -- Positive But Revealing:**
> **"I love my job... Its a very interesting job love the work we do. And the fact that we get to travel."**
-- Indeed employee review (Source: https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Epoxy-Systems/reviews)

On the surface this is positive. But "the fact that we get to travel" in a blasting/coating shop context means employees are being sent to field jobs -- which requires travel coordination, per diem management, remote crew supervision, and schedule juggling that a small office with one Office Manager would struggle to manage systematically.

**Two Websites, Two Email Domains, Two Facility Names:**
The company operates as both "Epoxy Systems Blasting & Coating" (epoxy-systems-blast-powder-paint.com) and "Epoxy Systems International" (epoxy-systems.com) with two separate websites, two separate email domains, and two BBB profiles. This is a classic sign of organic growth without operational consolidation -- the business expanded its service lines and never unified its systems, branding, or communication infrastructure.

**Fax Number in 2026:**
The company still prominently lists a fax number: (513) 924-1900. While some industrial clients may still fax POs and specs, maintaining fax as a primary communication channel signals legacy processes that haven't been modernized.

**Not BBB Accredited Despite 25+ Years:**
Similar pattern to other prospects -- long-standing business that wins work through relationships and quality, not through any systematic marketing or reputation management.

**Alignable Presence:**
The company is listed on Alignable (a networking platform for small businesses), suggesting they're interested in local business networking but using a platform with limited ROI -- another signal of wanting to grow but not knowing where to invest.

### Tech Stack Clues
- Websites: PHP 5.6 (!), WordPress.org, Google Font API (Source: ZoomInfo)
- PHP 5.6 is critically outdated (end-of-life since December 2018) -- security risk and signal of unmaintained web infrastructure
- Two separate websites with separate domains, separate email domains
- Fax machine still in active use
- No CRM, scheduling, or project management software visible
- No customer portal or online quoting
- No safety management software visible (relevant for blasting/coatings work)
- No estimating or job costing tools visible
- LinkedIn company page exists but minimal activity
- Alignable profile for local networking

### Why This is a Top Prospect
Epoxy Systems is a privately-owned industrial services company with 25+ years of experience, two facilities, 11-50 employees, and a General Manager (Ray Litmer) who is a deep coatings industry expert -- but the operational infrastructure is visibly fragmented. Two websites, two email domains, two brand names, a fax machine, PHP 5.6, and one Office Manager (Julie Ott) trying to hold it all together. The company does travel/field work in addition to shop work, adding logistical complexity that small-business tools can't handle. Ray Litmer has worn every hat in the coatings industry (contractor, distributor, manufacturer's rep) and knows the trade inside-out, but the back-office systems haven't kept pace with the operational complexity. Julie Ott (Office Manager) is the natural first contact as the Backbone persona, followed by Ray Litmer as the Reluctant Operator who built the business on technical expertise. Rated 2-MED rather than 1-HIGH because the Indeed reviews are limited and the pain signals are more structural (fragmented systems) than acute (customer complaints, employee turnover).

## DISQUALIFIED COMPANIES

### Rizzo Brothers Inc. -- ALREADY IN DATABASE
- **Reason:** Already tracked as a known entity in the existing database. Commercial/industrial painting and coatings contractor in Covington, KY. Borderline too large at 50-99 employees. Founded 1954. Would be a top prospect if not already known.

### CertaPro Painters of Cincinnati and NKY -- FRANCHISE
- **Reason:** National franchise (400+ locations worldwide). Each location independently owned, but corporate brand, systems, and processes are dictated by franchisor. Not an independent small business.

### Induspray USA -- NATIONAL COMPANY
- **Reason:** Headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with offices in Tempe, AZ. National/international industrial painting contractor operating across the Midwest and Northeast. Not a local independent business -- Cincinnati is just one of many service cities.

### G-FORCE Parking Lot Striping (Greater Cincinnati) -- FRANCHISE
- **Reason:** National franchise with 49 locations. Greater Cincinnati location is veteran-owned (Eric Rine, USAF Reserves) and independently operated, but corporate systems, branding, and processes come from the franchisor. Veteran Service Brands portfolio company.

### Turner Painting Company (Middletown/Cincinnati) -- TOO SMALL
- **Reason:** Two separate Turner Painting entities found. Turner Painting & Carpentry (Cincinnati, Dylan Turner owner) has 1-4 employees and <$500K revenue -- too small. Turner Painting & Construction (Middletown, Justin Turner co-owner) is a separate entity but also appears small-scale. Neither meets the 5-80 employee threshold for commercial/industrial work.

### Five Star Painting / Fresh Coat Painters -- FRANCHISE
- **Reason:** Both are national painting franchises (Five Star is Neighborly brand, Fresh Coat is franchise system). Disqualified per exclusion criteria.

### Armor Paint Services / Huber General Contracting -- BUNDLED WITH GC
- **Reason:** Armor Paint Services is the painting division of Huber General Contracting, a full-service licensed general contractor in Cincinnati. While locally owned (25+ years), the painting operation is a division within a GC rather than an independent painting contractor. Huber GC's operational systems likely govern the painting division. Could revisit if the painting division operates more independently than it appears, but current signals suggest it's an integrated GC operation.

### Fitzwater Commercial Services (FCS) -- INSUFFICIENT DATA / POSSIBLE PROSPECT
- **Reason:** Locally owned by Michael Fitzwater, 25+ years in Cincinnati, offers commercial painting plus property maintenance (parking lot sweeping, pressure washing, handyman, epoxy floors, line striping). Could be a solid prospect but insufficient data on employee count, revenue, and organizational structure to qualify. **RECOMMEND: Revisit with direct outreach to gather qualifying data.** Phone: Contact via fitzwatercs.com.

### Southwestern Ohio Services LLC -- NICHE / INSUFFICIENT DATA
- **Reason:** Family-owned line striping and asphalt maintenance company since 1979 in Cincinnati. Led by Laura Hrnyak (President) and Nick Hrnyak (Owner). BBB profile exists. Services include parking lot striping, sealcoating, thermoplastic markings, warehouse floor striping. Technically qualifies as a specialty painting contractor, but the business model is closer to asphalt maintenance than painting contracting. Insufficient data on employee count and revenue. **RECOMMEND: Revisit if expanding prospect list to include pavement marking/maintenance contractors.** Phone: (513) 623-2313, estimating@wepaintlines.com.

### King Custom Coatings -- TOO NEW / NICHE
- **Reason:** Family-owned epoxy floor coatings company, founded 2018. Primarily residential garage floor coatings. May not meet 2+ years threshold depending on exact founding date, and service focus is residential rather than commercial/industrial.

### Commander Coatings (Batavia, OH) -- NICHE / INSUFFICIENT DATA
- **Reason:** Industrial powder coating services. State-of-the-art facility. Insufficient data to qualify. Different business model (shop-based powder coating) than field painting contractors. Could revisit.

### Key Observations for This Vertical
1. **Commercial/industrial painting is a relationship-driven subcontractor business.** These companies win work through GC relationships, not marketing. This means their digital presence is minimal by design, not by oversight -- but it also means their back-office is optimized for "Bob knows the GC's project manager" rather than systematic bid tracking and project management.

2. **Safety compliance is a major operational burden in this vertical.** Sandblasting, industrial coatings, confined space work, lead paint abatement, and chemical handling all carry serious OSHA requirements. For companies without safety management software, this is a paper-based nightmare.

3. **The generational transition pattern is strong.** Leach (4th gen), Lehn (founder still president but next gen in PM roles), Hy-Blast (3rd gen VP/Ops), and Epoxy Systems (founder/owner still running day-to-day) all show the classic pattern of skilled-trade businesses where the founder built it on craft and relationships, and the next generation is inheriting the operational debt.

4. **Employee retention is a universal pain point.** The skilled trades labor shortage means these companies are competing for painters, blasters, and coaters against larger contractors with better benefits. Hy-Blast's $12/hour working interview and tiered pay structure, and Lehn Painting's active careers page, both signal ongoing hiring challenges.

5. **Two companies (Lehn Painting and Epoxy Systems) show signs of attempted modernization.** Lehn has Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (ERP). Epoxy Systems has two websites and two email domains. Both suggest someone tried to professionalize the infrastructure but the effort was partial or incomplete -- the classic "bought the software but never fully implemented it" pattern that is an excellent conversation opener for an ops consultancy.

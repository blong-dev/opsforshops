# NEW LAW FIRM PROSPECTS

## Priority 1 (Strongest Pain Signals)

### Joslyn Law Firm
- **Priority**: 1-HIGH
- **Website**: https://www.criminalattorneycincinnati.com/
- **Location**: 1117 Broadway St, Cincinnati, OH 45202 (also Columbus, Dayton — 6 locations total)
- **Founded**: 2011
- **Size**: ~15-20 employees across locations (5+ attorneys, support staff, COO)
- **Services**: Criminal defense, DUI/OVI, family law, divorce, traffic law
- **Key People**:
  - Brian D. Joslyn — Founder/Managing Partner
  - Angie Joslyn — COO (Chief Operations Officer)
  - Ryan Shazier — Lead Attorney (Cincinnati)
  - Justin McMullen — Associate Attorney
- **Contact**: (513) 399-6289; info@criminalattorneycincinnati.com (GENERIC)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - Glassdoor review titled **"Management and Gossip Nightmare"**: "bad/problematic management, poor business strategy, revolving door of employees, little to no training for new employees, toxic work environment, heavy on gossip/snark from co-workers, somewhat dubious business practices"
  - Review also notes: "there are currently no people of color at the firm" and "unequal treatment of people of color who previously worked there"
  - **"Revolving door of employees"** = turnover signal = onboarding/training gaps
  - BBB Accredited (A+) but consumer complaint mentions "misleading case representation and poor communication from attorneys"
  - Annual overhead ~$1M per Authority Magazine interview — scaling pains are real
  - 6 locations = coordination and consistency challenges
- **Tech Stack**: No practice management software mentioned publicly. Multi-location firm with no visible client portal. High marketing spend (SEO-heavy website).
- **Why Ops for Shops**: The Glassdoor "revolving door" review is a flashing red light. When employees churn, institutional knowledge walks out the door, onboarding costs spike, and operational consistency collapses — especially across 6 locations. The COO (Angie Joslyn) is the ideal outreach target. A firm this size with this turnover is almost certainly relying on ad-hoc training and tribal knowledge rather than documented systems and workflows.

### CMRS Law (Cornetet, Meyer, Rush & Spillane)
- **Priority**: 1-HIGH
- **Website**: https://cmrs-law.com/
- **Location**: 3 offices — Springdale/Tri-County (123 Boggs Ln), Hyde Park (3322 Erie Ave), Western Hills (3737 West Fork Rd)
- **Founded**: 1968
- **Size**: ~8-12 attorneys + support staff (~20-30 total estimated). Attorneys include Michael Spillane, Olivia K. Smith, John B. Cornetet, Christopher Diedling, Elliott Stapleton, plus others.
- **Services**: Estate planning, probate, real estate, civil litigation, consumer protection, small business, Medicaid long-term care, elder law
- **Key People**:
  - Michael S. Spillane — Partner (civil litigation, real estate, small business)
  - John B. Cornetet — Partner/CFP (estate planning, financial planning)
  - Elliott Stapleton — Attorney (probate, business, estate planning)
  - Olivia K. Smith — Partner (estate planning, Medicaid, special needs)
  - Christopher Diedling — Partner (estate planning, estate administration)
- **Contact**: (513) 771-7500; No general email found publicly
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **Actively hiring Litigation Attorney-Partner AND Domestic Relations Attorney** on Glassdoor — two attorney-level openings simultaneously = growth pains or attrition
  - Glassdoor rating: 3.2/5 stars (58% would recommend) — below-average for a law firm
  - 3 offices since 1968 but no visible client portal, no online intake, no case status system
  - Broad practice areas across 5+ attorneys in 3 locations = coordination complexity
  - Offering "fully remote or hybrid" arrangements — suggests they are adapting but may lack infrastructure to support it
- **Tech Stack**: No practice management software visible. Website is WordPress-based, functional but not modern. No client portal. Remote/hybrid offered but no collaboration tools mentioned.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: A 56-year-old firm with 3 locations, 3.2 Glassdoor stars, and two simultaneous attorney openings is a firm under operational strain. The breadth of practice areas (estate, litigation, real estate, elder law) across multiple offices means document management, client communication, and workflow standardization are constant challenges. The hybrid/remote policy without visible supporting tech suggests they are making promises their infrastructure may not fully deliver on.

### Niehaus Law Office
- **Priority**: 1-HIGH
- **Website**: https://www.niehauslaw.com/
- **Location**: 5600 Harrison Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45248
- **Founded**: 1978
- **Size**: 4 attorneys + 5 support staff = ~9 employees. Attorneys: Francis J. Niehaus (JD, CFP), David D. Kammer, Anne M. Niehaus, Stephen T. Canfield-Doyle. Staff: Ellie Aud, Kelly Caradonna, Tanya Duffy, Linda Koo, Natalie Luken.
- **Services**: Estate planning (wills, trusts, POA, living wills), estate/trust administration, elder law, nursing home Medicaid planning. Also operates Niehaus Tax Services and Niehaus Financial Services as sibling entities.
- **Key People**:
  - Francis J. Niehaus — Founder/Lead Attorney/CFP
  - Anne M. Niehaus — Attorney (family member, second generation)
  - David D. Kammer — Attorney
  - Stephen T. Canfield-Doyle — Attorney
- **Contact**: (513) 251-4900; office@niehauslaw.com (CONFIRMED — on website)
- **Pain Signals**:
  - **11,000+ wills prepared and 3,000+ estates administered since 1978** — this is a massive volume of legacy documents and ongoing administration. Where are they all stored? How are they tracked?
  - Three sibling businesses (law, tax, financial planning) under one roof = siloed systems almost guaranteed
  - Founded 1978 = 48 years of accumulated files, processes, and institutional habits
  - Family-run (Francis and Anne Niehaus) = generational succession planning likely underway
  - 4:5 attorney-to-staff ratio suggests heavy administrative workload per attorney
  - No client portal visible. Website is functional but dated in design.
- **Tech Stack**: No practice management software mentioned. Three related businesses (law, tax, financial planning) likely use different software stacks. Website is basic WordPress. No online intake or client portal.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: 48 years, 11,000 wills, 3,000 estates, three sibling businesses, and a generational transition. This firm almost certainly has decades of paper and legacy digital files, siloed systems across the law/tax/financial planning entities, and a looming question about how Anne Niehaus (second generation) will modernize when she takes the reins. The volume alone demands systematization.

## Priority 2 (Solid Prospects, Moderate Pain Signals)

### Engel & Martin, LLC
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://engelandmartin.com/
- **Location**: Mason, OH (near Cincinnati) and Columbus, OH
- **Founded**: ~1998 (25+ years)
- **Size**: ~7 employees, $13M revenue (per Kona Equity). Attorneys: Joshua Engel, Mary Martin, Anne Tamashasky, Jim Hardin.
- **Services**: Criminal defense, Title IX defense, campus crime, federal criminal defense, drug crimes, appeals
- **Key People**:
  - Joshua Adam Engel — Founding Partner (former prosecutor)
  - Mary Martin — Partner (former prosecutor, appellate specialist)
  - Anne Tamashasky — Attorney
  - Jim Hardin — Attorney (former prosecutor)
- **Contact**: (513) 445-9600; No general email found publicly
- **Pain Signals**:
  - $13M revenue with only ~7 employees = extremely lean operation, high revenue per head
  - 2 offices (Mason + Columbus) = coordination challenges
  - Niche practice (Title IX, campus crime) = heavy document discovery, complex case files
  - All attorneys are former prosecutors = high standards but likely limited ops/admin focus
  - No Glassdoor/Indeed employee reviews found = either very small or employees don't post
- **Tech Stack**: No practice management software visible. Website is modern and well-designed. No client portal mentioned.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: A $13M firm running on ~7 people across 2 offices is running extremely hot. Title IX and federal criminal cases involve massive discovery and document volumes. If they don't have bulletproof systems, they are relying on individual heroics. The ratio suggests either excellent systems (unlikely given no visible tech) or unsustainable intensity.

### Moermond & Mulligan, LLC
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://www.mmdefense.law/
- **Location**: Cincinnati, OH 45202 (also Dayton)
- **Founded**: 1994
- **Size**: ~10 employees, 2 locations. Attorneys: L. Patrick Mulligan (founder), Brad Moermond (co-founder), plus associates.
- **Services**: Criminal defense (state and federal), drug crimes, drug trafficking, DUI, white-collar crime
- **Key People**:
  - L. Patrick Mulligan — Founder (Board Certified Criminal Law Specialist)
  - Brad Moermond — Co-Founder
- **Contact**: (513) 421-9790; No general email found publicly
- **Pain Signals**:
  - 30+ years in business, 2 locations, ~10 employees = established but small
  - 50+ years combined attorney experience but no visible operational infrastructure
  - 786 reviews on Birdeye = high volume of cases, meaning high administrative throughput
  - Mixed Google reviews: some mention case preparation concerns
  - No client portal, no online intake, no visible case management system
  - Criminal defense = time-sensitive, document-heavy, court-deadline-driven
- **Tech Stack**: No practice management software visible. Website is functional but basic. No client portal or online scheduling.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: A 30-year criminal defense firm handling high case volumes across 2 locations. Criminal defense is inherently deadline-driven and document-heavy. The lack of visible client-facing technology (no portal, no online intake) suggests the back office may also be running on older methods. The sheer review volume (786 Birdeye reviews) indicates a high-throughput operation where administrative efficiency is critical.

### Lindhorst & Dreidame Co., LPA
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://www.lindhorstlaw.com/
- **Location**: Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded**: 1943
- **Size**: ~13 attorneys, ~14+ total employees
- **Services**: Business litigation, employment law, commercial real estate, corporate formation, contracts, mergers & acquisitions
- **Key People**:
  - (Managing Partner not identified from search — requires further research)
- **Contact**: (513) 241-6650; No general email found publicly
- **Pain Signals**:
  - Founded 1943 = 83 years old, one of the oldest independent firms in Cincinnati
  - 13 attorneys in a single office serving businesses across OH and KY = heavy caseload concentration
  - Business litigation + employment law = discovery-intensive, document-heavy practice areas
  - Employment law practice means they should understand HR/ops pain — but do they apply it internally?
  - No client portal visible. Careers page exists but no current openings listed.
- **Tech Stack**: No practice management software visible. Website is professional but doesn't showcase any technology. No client portal.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: An 83-year-old firm with 13 attorneys doing business litigation and employment law. These are among the most document-intensive practice areas in law. The irony of an employment law firm potentially having its own internal operations challenges is a compelling outreach angle. The age of the firm suggests deep-rooted legacy processes.

### Ernst & Associates, LLC
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://www.ernstfirm.com/
- **Location**: 212 W 8th St, Cincinnati, OH 45202
- **Founded**: 1996
- **Size**: ~5-6 attorneys + support staff (~10-15 total estimated). Attorneys: Matthew T. Ernst (founder), Jagdeep S. Sangha, Connor P. Reilly, Jessica A. Ernst, Laura R. Gibson, Jordan Schultz.
- **Services**: Criminal defense, DUI, drug charges, violent crimes, domestic violence, white-collar crime
- **Key People**:
  - Matthew T. Ernst — Founder/Owner (20+ years experience)
  - Jessica A. Ernst — Attorney (family member)
  - Jagdeep S. Sangha — Attorney
  - Connor P. Reilly — Attorney
- **Contact**: (513) 338-1890; No general email found publicly
- **Pain Signals**:
  - 60+ years of collective experience across 6 attorneys = significant institutional knowledge at risk
  - Family-run (Matthew + Jessica Ernst) = succession planning considerations
  - 6 attorneys is the "messy middle" — too big for one person to manage informally, too small for a dedicated admin layer
  - Criminal defense = deadline-driven, court-filing-intensive
  - No client portal visible
- **Tech Stack**: No practice management software visible. Website is modern and well-designed with good photography. No client portal.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: 6 attorneys in the "messy middle" of firm size. Too many people for the founder to personally oversee every workflow, but probably too few to justify a full-time operations manager. This is exactly where systematized processes and automation deliver the most leverage. Family-run dynamic adds succession planning urgency.

### The Moore Law Firm
- **Priority**: 2-MED
- **Website**: https://www.moorelaw.com/
- **Location**: 1060 Nimitzview Dr, Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded**: 2008
- **Size**: ~5-8 employees (3 named attorneys: Dan, Kelly, Derek + paralegals/support)
- **Services**: Personal injury, wrongful death, auto accidents, medical malpractice, premises liability
- **Key People**:
  - (Specific names: Dan Moore, Kelly Moore, Derek Moore — family firm)
- **Contact**: (513) 232-2000; No general email found publicly
- **Pain Signals**:
  - Family-run PI firm with "50+ years of combined experience" but founded 2008
  - Markets itself as having "resources of larger law firms" with "intimate atmosphere" — classic scaling tension
  - PI firms run on contingency = cash flow depends on case throughput and settlement efficiency
  - No client portal despite being a PI firm (where client communication is critical)
  - Yelp reviews exist but limited volume
- **Tech Stack**: Website is modern and well-structured. No client portal or case status tracker visible. No practice management software mentioned.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: A family PI firm that explicitly claims to combine big-firm resources with small-firm service. That tension is real — and it only works with strong systems. PI firms live and die by case throughput, and every missed deadline or lost document is money left on the table. The family dynamic (three Moores) means the firm may rely on informal communication rather than documented processes.

## Priority 3 (Worth Tracking, Limited Pain Signals Found)

### Ahlrichs & Foran, LPA
- **Priority**: 3-LOW
- **Website**: https://ahlrichslaw.com/

- **Key People**:
  - Melanie Foran — Attorney/Partner
- **Contact**: (513) 921-2227; No email found publicly
- **Pain Signals**:
  - 69 years in business = deep legacy processes and accumulated files
  - "Intimate size" = manual, relationship-driven operations
  - General practice across family law + estate + probate = jack-of-all-trades admin burden
  - No visible technology or client-facing digital tools
- **Tech Stack**: Website is basic. No client portal. No practice management tools visible.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: A nearly 70-year-old firm on the West Side with a general practice. The longevity suggests stability but also deeply entrenched manual processes. Worth tracking but limited pain signals found in public sources.

### Beth Silverman & Associates, LLC
- **Priority**: 3-LOW

- **Location**: Cincinnati, OH

- **Key People**:
  - Beth Silverman — Founder (40+ years practicing family law)
  - Laura Thudium — Attorney
- **Contact**: (513) 793-2227; No general email found publicly
- **Pain Signals**:
  - 40+ years exclusively in family law = massive accumulated case history
  - Only 2 attorneys = very small, may be below the 5-employee threshold
  - Sole focus on family law = document-intensive (financial disclosures, custody evaluations)
- **Tech Stack**: Website is clean and modern. No client portal visible.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: Very small firm that may be below our 5-employee threshold. Worth tracking if they grow or if Beth Silverman is considering succession/retirement planning.

- **Key People**:
  - Ryan DeBra — Founder

  - Criminal + family law = two document-intensive practice areas
  - Positive reviews but small scale limits operational complexity
- **Tech Stack**: Squarespace website. No client portal.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: Very small firm. Good reviews but likely below our 5-employee minimum. Track for growth.

---

- **Priority**: 3-LOW
- **Website**: https://kellyfarrishlaw.com/
- **Location**: 810 Sycamore St, Cincinnati, OH 45202 (+ Scripps Center office)
- **Founded**: Est. ~2000s (65+ years combined attorney experience)

  - Doug Nicholas — Attorney
  - Robert Dziech — Attorney (former Hamilton County prosecutor)
- **Contact**: (513) 621-2100; No general email found publicly
- **Pain Signals**:
  - 2 office locations for a small firm = coordination overhead
  - Broad practice (DUI + criminal + PI + domestic) = diverse workflow needs
  - Former prosecutors on staff = high standards for case preparation
- **Tech Stack**: Website is functional. No client portal visible.
- **Why Ops for Shops**: Small firm with 2 offices and broad practice coverage. Worth tracking but limited pain signals found.

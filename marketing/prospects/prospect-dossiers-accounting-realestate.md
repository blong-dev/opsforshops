# PART A: ACCOUNTING / BOOKKEEPING / PAYROLL PROSPECTS

---

## PROSPECT 1: BookWerks LLC

### Priority: 2-MED

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** BookWerks LLC
- **Website:** https://bookwerks.io/
- **Phone:** (513) 313-4ERK (513-313-4375)
- **Location:** 9200 Montgomery Rd, Suite 25-A, Cincinnati, OH 45242
- **Founded:** 2014 (some sources say 2016 as merger of predecessor entities)
- **Employees:** ~5-15 (estimated; ZoomInfo shows small team, Manta lists as small business)
- **Revenue:** Not publicly disclosed

### Services
Cloud-based outsourced bookkeeping for small businesses and entrepreneurs. Serves dental, veterinary, funeral, hair salon, retail, software, wealth management, landscaping, graphic design, and restaurant verticals. Xero-preferred firm; also supports QuickBooks.

### Key People
- **Jim Kokenge** -- President & Founder. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/jimkokenge/. Email: INFERRED jim@bookwerks.io or jkokenge@bookwerks.io. Former non-accountant who founded the firm to serve small business owners.

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @bookwerks.io (confirmed from Xero advisor listing)
- Confidence: **INFERRED**

### Pain Signals
- **Glassdoor:** Only 1 review on file -- insufficient data but the fact that reviews exist at all for a firm this size suggests some turnover.
- **Growth strain:** LinkedIn testimonials reference "tremendous growth" under Kokenge's leadership, suggesting scaling challenges.
- **Vertical specialization:** Serving 10+ distinct industry verticals from a small team = stretched thin on industry-specific knowledge and client communication.

### Tech Stack
- **Xero** (preferred; dedicated page on site: "Cincinnati Xero Experts")
- **QuickBooks** (supported but not preferred)
- Cloud-based model with bank feed integrations
- Xero add-on ecosystem (POS, time tracking, inventory, invoicing)

### Why Ops for Shops
BookWerks serves the exact same small-business market that Ops for Shops targets. A cloud-based bookkeeping firm managing 10+ industry verticals with a small team almost certainly has workflow bottlenecks around client onboarding, document collection, and reporting cycles. Jim Kokenge is a non-accountant founder, making him receptive to operational efficiency pitches rather than purely accounting-focused solutions. Potential partner/referral relationship as well.

## PROSPECT 2: Professional Payroll Services, Inc.

### Priority: 1-HIGH

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Professional Payroll Services, Inc.
- **Website:** https://cincypayroll.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 761-2860
- **Location:** 8832 Reading Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45215
- **Founded:** ~1980 (in business 30+ years per website)
- **Employees:** ~10-20 (estimated from service model -- each client assigned a dedicated payroll processor)
- **Revenue:** Not publicly disclosed
- **BBB:** Listed but NOT accredited (BBB profile: bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/payroll-services/professional-payroll-svc-0292-13002813)

### Services
Full payroll processing, tax compliance, payroll reporting, garnishment processing, 401K reporting, direct deposit, check printing & delivery. Each client gets a dedicated, assigned payroll processor.

### Key People
- **Owner:** Not publicly identified. Company website does not list leadership.
- **Contact:** Use main phone (513) 761-2860 and ask for owner/general manager.

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @cincypayroll.com (from website)
- Generic: info@cincypayroll.com (likely)
- Confidence: **GENERIC**

### Pain Signals
- **BBB not accredited** after 40+ years in business -- suggests either disinterest in formal credentials or unresolved complaints.
- **Yelp:** Listed but limited reviews (1 review noted on Yelp page).
- **Dedicated processor model:** Each client gets one assigned person = single points of failure, knowledge silos, vacation/sick day coverage gaps.
- **Legacy firm (est. ~1980):** 40+ year old payroll firm almost certainly running legacy processes and possibly legacy software. High probability of manual workflows.

### Tech Stack
- Not publicly disclosed. A payroll firm this old likely uses a mix of legacy payroll software with manual processes. No mention of modern platforms like Gusto, Rippling, or cloud payroll.

### Why Ops for Shops
A 40+ year old independent payroll shop with dedicated-processor staffing model is a textbook case for operational modernization. The single-point-of-failure risk with each client assigned to one person creates coverage gaps and knowledge silos. If the owner is approaching retirement, succession planning and process documentation become urgent. The BBB non-accreditation suggests potential quality control or process issues that systematized operations could address.

## PROSPECT 3: 513 Payroll / 937 Payroll

### Priority: 2-MED

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** 513 Payroll (Cincinnati) / 937 Payroll (Dayton) -- same company
- **Website:** https://www.513payroll.com/ and https://www.937payroll.com/
- **Phone:** Not publicly listed on main site; BBB: Dayton listing
- **Location:** 31 S Main St, Dayton, OH (HQ); serves Cincinnati metro
- **Founded:** May 2017 (incorporated 5/1/2017)
- **Employees:** ~5-10 (estimated; small independent firm)
- **Owner:** Bryan Hunter, President
- **BBB:** Accredited (bbb.org/us/oh/dayton/profile/payroll-services/937-payroll-0322-44437)

### Services
Payroll processing, direct deposit, check printing & delivery, general ledger integration, pay cards, tax filing, online access, garnishments, new hire reporting, labor law posters, time & attendance, HR services, employee management, hiring & onboarding.

### Key People
- **Bryan Hunter** -- President & Owner. Founded 2017.

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @937payroll.com or @513payroll.com
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- try bryan@937payroll.com or bhunter@937payroll.com

### Pain Signals
- **Young firm, rapid expansion:** Founded 2017, already operating under two brands (513 and 937 area codes) serving Dayton, Cincinnati, and Columbus. Rapid geographic expansion without proportional staff growth.
- **Yelp:** Limited reviews -- low visibility despite 7+ years in business.
- **Broad service menu for small team:** Offering payroll, HR, time & attendance, onboarding from what appears to be a very small team.

### Tech Stack
- Website says "backed by the nation's leading payroll processor" -- likely white-labeling a larger platform (possibly iSolved, Paylocity, or similar).
- Online access portal for clients.

### Why Ops for Shops
A 7-year-old payroll company operating under two brands across three Ohio metros with a small team is in a classic growth-without-infrastructure phase. Bryan Hunter is likely the "Reluctant Operator" -- a payroll expert who now spends more time on marketing, sales, and operations than on actual payroll work. Process documentation, client onboarding workflows, and cross-brand consistency are likely pain points.

---

## PROSPECT 4: MLA Companies

### Priority: 1-HIGH

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** MLA Companies
- **Website:** https://mlacompanies.com/
- **Phone:** Not publicly listed (contact form on site)
- **Location:** MLA Center for Stewardship, Springboro, OH (between Dayton and Cincinnati); also Cincinnati office
- **Founded:** 2006
- **Employees:** ~30 professionals
- **Revenue:** Not disclosed; serves 60+ clients
- **Owner:** Seth Morgan, President & CEO

### Services
Fractional/outsourced CFO services, financial advisory, accounting, transitional services for small- and medium-sized businesses. Acquired LGI CFO to expand capabilities. Serves clients ranging from pre-revenue to $100M+, with 2/3 between $2-30M revenue.

### Key People
- **Seth Morgan** -- President & CEO, Founder (2006). LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/sethmorgan
- **Steve Lumley** -- Leader, Financial Advisory Team

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @mlacompanies.com (inferred from website)
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- try seth@mlacompanies.com or smorgan@mlacompanies.com

### Pain Signals
- **Glassdoor/Indeed:** Positive reviews overall, but one Indeed reviewer noted a rapid 3-interview hiring process (same-day response), suggesting urgency to fill roles.
- **Acquisition integration:** Acquired LGI CFO -- integration of two firms creates operational complexity around client management, billing, and staff coordination.
- **30 people serving 60+ clients:** Each professional managing 2+ client relationships simultaneously = scheduling, reporting, and communication complexity.
- **Multi-state operations:** Personnel in Ohio, Virginia, and Florida with clients nationwide = remote coordination challenges.

### Tech Stack
- Not publicly disclosed. Fractional CFO firms typically use QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite, Sage Intacct, Bill.com, and various reporting/dashboard tools. The lack of any tech mentions on the website is itself a signal.

### Why Ops for Shops
MLA is the ideal Ops for Shops client: a 30-person professional services firm managing 60+ client relationships across multiple states, with a recent acquisition to integrate. Seth Morgan founded the company on a "stewardship" philosophy, which aligns with Ops for Shops' ethos of helping owners build sustainable businesses. The fractional CFO model means MLA's own back-office operations need to be exceptionally efficient to deliver quality to clients -- any internal operational friction directly impacts client deliverables.

## PROSPECT 5: Supporting Strategies | Greater Cincinnati

### Priority: 2-MED

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Supporting Strategies | Greater Cincinnati Ohio
- **Website:** https://www.supportingstrategies.com/locations/greater-cincinnati-ohio/
- **Phone:** (859) 444-0238
- **Location:** Park Hills, KY (Northern Kentucky / Cincinnati metro)
- **Founded:** Greater Cincinnati location launched January 2020 (national brand founded earlier)
- **Employees:** ~5-15 (local team; national brand has 90+ locations)
- **Managing Director:** Craig (last name not publicly listed)

### Services
Outsourced bookkeeping, controller services, and operational support for growing businesses. All US-based employees with average 10 years experience and bachelor's degrees in accounting.

### Key People
- **Craig [Last Name TBD]** -- Managing Director, Greater Cincinnati. Cincinnati native, education in business and law.

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @supportingstrategies.com
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- try craig@supportingstrategies.com or use contact form

### Pain Signals
- **Franchise-adjacent model:** Supporting Strategies is a national brand with 90+ locations, but each location is independently owned/operated. The Greater Cincinnati location launched in 2020 (during COVID) -- early growth phase.
- **Customer testimonials are overwhelmingly positive** -- limited pain signals externally, but a 5-year-old location in growth mode has internal scaling challenges.

### Tech Stack
- Not disclosed for Cincinnati location. National brand likely standardizes on QuickBooks Online, Xero, Bill.com, and other cloud accounting tools.

### Why Ops for Shops
Supporting Strategies Greater Cincinnati is a locally-owned franchise-model bookkeeping firm in growth phase. Craig's dual business/law background suggests analytical decision-making. The challenge for a bookkeeping firm serving multiple clients is maintaining quality as the client roster grows -- workflow automation, client onboarding systems, and document management are likely areas where Ops for Shops can help. Note: May be borderline on "independent" criterion given national brand affiliation.

## PROSPECT 6: Ohio Tax Service, Inc.

### Priority: 2-MED

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Ohio Tax Service, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.ohiotaxservice.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 761-5455
- **Location:** 7162 Reading Rd, Suite 105, Cincinnati, OH 45237
- **Founded:** 1939 (originally founded by Baxter Moore, a Procter & Gamble employee doing tax returns part-time)
- **Employees:** 11-50 (BBB listing)
- **President:** Ms. Leanne L. Greenberg
- **BBB:** Listed but NOT accredited

### Services
Personal income tax preparation (Form 1040), itemized deductions, gambling winnings/losses, stock sales, rentals, farms, small unincorporated businesses. Year-round services.

### Key People
- **Leanne L. Greenberg** -- President

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @ohiotaxservice.com (inferred from website)
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- try lgreenberg@ohiotaxservice.com or leanne@ohiotaxservice.com

### Pain Signals
- **BBB not accredited** despite being in business since 1939 -- 85+ years without BBB accreditation is notable.
- **Legacy firm:** Founded 1939, acquired and restructured multiple times. Likely running legacy processes and systems accumulated over decades.
- **Seasonal staffing surge:** Tax preparation firms with 11-50 employees have massive seasonal scaling challenges (January-April) and then must manage down. This creates training, quality control, and knowledge management headaches every year.
- **Leadership transitions:** Multiple ownership changes over the decades suggest periodic operational disruption.

### Tech Stack
- Not disclosed. An 85-year-old tax prep firm likely uses professional tax software (Drake, Lacerte, UltraTax, ProSeries) but internal operations/workflow may be manual.

### Why Ops for Shops
Ohio Tax Service is an 85-year-old Cincinnati institution with 11-50 employees and a classic seasonal staffing challenge. Every year they must onboard, train, and then release seasonal tax preparers -- a repeatable process that benefits enormously from documented workflows, checklists, and standardized training systems. Leanne Greenberg inherited a firm with decades of accumulated processes that likely need modernization. The BBB non-accreditation after 85 years suggests quality control gaps that systemization could address.

## PROSPECT 7: Donohoo Accounting Services & Property Management, Inc.

### Priority: 3-LOW

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Donohoo Accounting Services & Property Management, Inc.
- **Website:** https://donohooaccountingservice.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 231-0888
- **Location:** 1080 Nimitzview Dr, Cincinnati, OH (Anderson Township)
- **Founded:** 1997
- **Employees:** ~5-10 (estimated; small firm)
- **Owner:** Duane Donohoo, President
- **BBB:** Accredited (bbb.org/us/oh/anderson-twp/profile/accounting/donohoo-accounting-services-property-management-inc-0292-90009658)

### Services
Income tax preparation, accounting & bookkeeping, tax planning, past due tax filings, wealth management, business valuations, AND property management. The dual accounting/property management model is unusual and creates operational complexity.

### Key People
- **Duane Donohoo** -- President & Owner. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/duanedonohoo/

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @donohooaccountingservice.com (inferred)
- Confidence: **INFERRED**

### Pain Signals
- **Dual business model:** Running both an accounting firm AND a property management company from what appears to be a small team is operationally complex. Two distinct client bases, two sets of compliance requirements, two workflows.
- **Small team, broad services:** Tax prep, bookkeeping, wealth management, business valuations, AND property management from ~5-10 employees.

### Tech Stack
- Not disclosed.

### Why Ops for Shops
The dual accounting/property management model creates unique operational complexity -- Duane Donohoo is managing two distinct business lines from a small team. This makes process documentation, cross-training, and workflow optimization especially valuable. Rated 3-LOW due to likely small size (may be under 5 employees) and owner-operator model where Duane may resist outside operational help.

## PROSPECT 8: Horizon Payroll Solutions

### Priority: 1-HIGH

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Horizon Payroll Solutions
- **Website:** https://www.horizonpayrollsolutions.com/
- **Phone:** Not publicly listed (contact form)
- **Location:** Southwest Ohio (serves Cincinnati, Dayton, Columbus, Cleveland, Chicago, and 40 states)
- **Founded:** ~2004 (Brad Johnson joined 2007 with 15+ years experience; team members have 15+ years with company)
- **Employees:** ~10-20 (estimated from named team members and service model)
- **President:** Brad Johnson (former CPA)
- **Clients:** ~1,000 customers in 40 states

### Services
Payroll processing, tax filing, HR solutions, time & attendance, onboarding, compliance, workers' comp, employee benefits administration.

### Key People
- **Brad Johnson** -- President. Former CPA from large public accounting firm. With Horizon since 2007.
- **Rebecca Sharp** -- Payroll Specialist (15+ years with firm)
- **Sandi Davis** -- Operations Assistant (40+ years industry experience, 3 years with Horizon)
- **Kelly Lawson** -- Office Assistant (4+ years with firm)

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @horizonpayrollsolutions.com (inferred)
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- try bjohnson@horizonpayrollsolutions.com or brad@horizonpayrollsolutions.com

### Pain Signals
- **Rapid client growth:** ~1,000 clients in 40 states from what appears to be a ~15-person team. That's roughly 65 clients per person.
- **Recent hires suggest scaling pain:** Sandi Davis (Operations Assistant) joined only 3 years ago with 40 years of industry experience -- hiring very senior people for operational roles suggests complexity.
- **Multi-state compliance:** Operating in 40 states means 40 different tax jurisdictions, compliance requirements, and regulatory updates to track.
- **Named Operations Assistant role:** The existence of a dedicated "Operations Assistant" title suggests operations are complex enough to warrant a dedicated role.

### Tech Stack
- Not publicly disclosed. Customer testimonials describe Horizon as a "partner" that learns specific challenges -- suggests customized/manual approaches rather than pure software automation.

### Why Ops for Shops
Horizon Payroll is managing nearly 1,000 clients across 40 states with what appears to be a lean team. Brad Johnson is a CPA-turned-business-owner -- the classic "Reluctant Operator" who built the business on technical expertise and now manages operations. The company's growth from a southwest Ohio shop to a 40-state operation creates enormous operational complexity around multi-state compliance, client onboarding, and quality control. The recent hiring of a senior Operations Assistant signals that they're feeling the strain.

## PROSPECT 9: FocusCFO (Cincinnati Metro Team)

### Priority: 3-LOW

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** FocusCFO
- **Website:** https://www.focuscfo.com/
- **Phone:** Not publicly listed
- **Location:** National; Cincinnati Metro team
- **Founded:** Not disclosed
- **Employees:** 140+ professionals nationally
- **Cincinnati Team:** Brian Tooley, Dan Keck, Michael Lawrence, Chris Meibers

### Services
Embedded fractional CFO services for small and medium businesses ($2M-$100M+ revenue). Former business owners and CFOs serving as part-time CFOs.

### Key People (Cincinnati Metro)
- **Brian Tooley** -- Fractional CFO, Cincinnati/Middletown
- **Dan Keck** -- Fractional CFO, Cincinnati
- **Michael Lawrence** -- Fractional CFO, Cincinnati Metro
- **Chris Meibers** -- Fractional CFO, Cincinnati Metro

### Pain Signals
- Limited -- FocusCFO is a large national firm (140+ people) that likely exceeds the target size and is well-organized.

### Why Ops for Shops
Rated 3-LOW because FocusCFO is a large national organization (140+ people) that likely has sophisticated internal operations already. However, the individual fractional CFOs operate semi-independently in their markets, and the Cincinnati team members could be referral partners -- they sit inside client businesses and see operational pain firsthand. Better as a **referral partner** than a direct prospect.

## PROSPECT 10: Lawyers Title of Cincinnati, Inc.

### Priority: 1-HIGH

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Lawyers Title of Cincinnati, Inc.
- **Website:** https://ltcincy.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 381-2424
- **Location:** Two offices in Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded:** June 12, 1936
- **Employees:** ~50 (confirmed from company history page)
- **Revenue:** Not disclosed
- **BBB:** Accredited since founding (bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/title-agent/lawyers-title-of-cincinnati-inc-0292-8083)
- **Status:** Largest independent title agency in southwestern Ohio

### Services
Residential and commercial title insurance, title searches, closings, settlement services. Handles more residential closings than any other independent agency in the region.

### Key People
- **Timothy D. Griffin** -- President & Co-Owner. Grandson of co-founder Earl W. Griffin.
- **Michael C. Fletcher** -- Executive Vice President & Co-Owner.

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @ltcincy.com (inferred from website)
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- try tgriffin@ltcincy.com or tim.griffin@ltcincy.com

### Pain Signals
- **Indeed employee reviews (mixed):**
  - Positive: "great company, friendly fast paced environment," "excellent benefits," "super management team"
  - Negative: "hired and laid off within a short period of time" after being "promised assignment and assured the position" -- suggests workforce planning issues
  - "managers do not listen or care about employees just want bottom line completed and production to continue" -- production pressure
  - "too many hours not paid for, poor management, low pay" -- workload/compensation mismatch
  - "unless you are in with someone there you will never advance or be hired" -- culture concerns
- **90-year-old firm:** Founded 1936. Third-generation family ownership. Legacy processes almost certainly embedded.
- **50 employees across 2 offices:** Cross-office coordination, document management, and workflow consistency are inherent challenges.
- **Highest-volume independent agency in region:** Volume = operational pressure. Every closing has dozens of documents, deadlines, and parties to coordinate.

### Tech Stack
- Not publicly disclosed. Title agencies of this size typically use SoftPro, RamQuest, or Qualia for title production. The lack of any tech mentions on the website for a 90-year-old firm suggests they may be on legacy systems.

### Why Ops for Shops
Lawyers Title of Cincinnati is a premier prospect: 50 employees, 90 years old, third-generation family ownership, highest-volume independent title agency in the region. The Indeed reviews reveal real operational pain -- production pressure, workforce planning failures, and management communication gaps. A firm this old with this much volume almost certainly has accumulated manual processes and workarounds that drag on efficiency. Timothy Griffin inherited a legacy operation that needs modernization to remain competitive against tech-forward newcomers like Qualia-powered shops.

## PROSPECT 11: Prominent Title Agency, LLC

### Priority: 1-HIGH

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Prominent Title Agency, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.prominenttitleagency.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 489-3588
- **Location:** 7365 E Kemper Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45249
- **Founded:** 2004
- **Employees:** 11-50
- **President:** Joseph Brooks
- **BBB:** Accredited since 12/16/2015

### Services
Title settlement, title search, loan closing, real estate closing services.

### Key People
- **Joseph Brooks** -- President

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @prominenttitleagency.com (inferred)
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- try jbrooks@prominenttitleagency.com

### Pain Signals
- **Indeed Employee Reviews (SEVERE):**
  - Overall rating: Very low across all categories
  - Work/Life Balance: 2.0/5
  - Compensation/Benefits: 1.5/5
  - Management: 2.0/5
  - Culture: 2.0/5
  - **Direct quote:** "the owners run the place like absolute lunatics and do not respect employees whatsoever"
  - **Direct quote:** "the pay is not even close to being worth it for what you deal with on a daily basis"
  - **Direct quote:** "if you are looking for a well paying, non soul crushing job this is not the place for you!"
- **Yelp (24 reviews, mixed):** Customer review: "Prominent Title did not handle any aspects of the transaction in a professional manner and have no concept of what good customer service looks like."
- **Angi:** Rated 2.5/5 overall.
- **Employee turnover:** The severity of Indeed reviews suggests high turnover, which creates perpetual training and knowledge loss problems.

### Tech Stack
- Not publicly disclosed.

### Why Ops for Shops
Prominent Title Agency has the most severe employee pain signals of any prospect in this research. The Indeed reviews paint a picture of a company with fundamental operational and management problems: disrespected employees, inadequate compensation, and poor work-life balance. While Joseph Brooks may or may not be receptive to outside help, the business case is clear -- employee turnover from these conditions is expensive, and systematic operational improvements (documented workflows, clear role definitions, fair workload distribution) could address the root causes. This is either a 1-HIGH opportunity or a disqualification depending on ownership receptivity.

## PROSPECT 12: Fidelity Land Title Agency of Cincinnati, Inc.

### Priority: 2-MED

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Fidelity Land Title Agency of Cincinnati, Inc.
- **Website:** https://fidelitylandtitle.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 579-0040
- **Location:** Cincinnati, OH (Montgomery Rd)
- **Founded:** February 1988
- **Employees:** 5-50 (sources vary; LinkedIn says 11-50, another source says 5)
- **BBB:** Accredited (bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/title-agent/fidelity-land-title-agency-inc-0292-1162218)

### Services
Full-service title and closing services. Managed by two attorneys.

### Key People
- **J. Terry Kennedy** -- Owner, Attorney
- **Sherri Murphy Kennedy** -- Co-Manager, Attorney
- **David Kennedy** -- CEO

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @fidelitylandtitle.com (inferred)
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- try tkennedy@fidelitylandtitle.com or david@fidelitylandtitle.com

### Pain Signals
- **Attorney-managed title agency:** Two attorneys running the business means high billable-hour opportunity cost for any time spent on operations vs. legal work.
- **38-year-old firm:** Established 1988 after acquiring assets of another company. Legacy processes likely.
- **Family business dynamics:** J. Terry Kennedy and Sherri Murphy Kennedy (married couple) plus David Kennedy (likely son as CEO) = family business succession dynamics.

### Tech Stack
- Not disclosed. Uses "titlecompanywebdesign.com" for their website platform -- a title-industry-specific web provider, suggesting they're connected to title industry vendors.

### Why Ops for Shops
Fidelity Land Title is a 38-year-old family-run title agency managed by two attorneys. Every minute the Kennedys spend on operational tasks is time not spent on closings and legal review. The family succession dynamic (David Kennedy as CEO) creates an opportunity -- the next generation often wants to modernize. The use of title-industry-specific web tools suggests some tech awareness but likely limited to front-end/marketing rather than back-office operations.

## PROSPECT 13: Cincinnatus Title, LLC

### Priority: 2-MED

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Cincinnatus Title, LLC
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatustitle.com/
- **Phone:** Not publicly listed on search results
- **Location:** Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded:** 2011
- **Employees:** Not disclosed (small firm)
- **BBB:** Listed (bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/title-insurance/cincinnatus-title-llc-0292-90051904)

### Services
Title insurance for homebuyers, borrowers, realtors, developers, builders, and lenders. Independent Cincinnati title company.

### Key People
- **Gene E. Carroll** -- Owner
- **Cynthia L. Luck** -- Owner

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @cincinnatustitle.com (inferred)
- Confidence: **INFERRED**

### Pain Signals
- **Dual ownership:** Two owners managing a small title company can create decision-making complexity.
- **13-year-old independent firm:** Old enough to have established processes but young enough that those processes may not be well-documented.
- **"50+ years of collective real estate experience"** = experienced team but possibly set in their ways with manual processes.

### Tech Stack
- Not disclosed.

### Why Ops for Shops
Cincinnatus Title is a smaller independent title company where two experienced owners are likely doing much of the operational work themselves. The "50+ years of collective experience" means deep industry knowledge that probably lives in their heads rather than in documented systems. As they think about scaling or eventual succession, getting that knowledge into repeatable processes becomes critical.

## PROSPECT 14: ACS Title & Closing Services

### Priority: 2-MED

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** ACS Title & Closing Services
- **Website:** https://www.acstitle.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 737-5454
- **Location:** Historic Mercantile Building, downtown Hamilton, OH
- **Founded:** 1995 (Cincinnati-area operation, established by Millikin & Fitton Law Firm)
- **Employees:** ~10-20 (estimated; over half staff has 20+ years experience)
- **BBB:** Not found in search results

### Services
Full-service title agency serving Butler, Warren, Hamilton, Preble, Clermont, and Montgomery counties. Title searches, closings, title insurance.

### Key People
- **Arlene Griffith** -- Named on staff page (likely senior title agent/manager)
- **Millikin & Fitton Law Firm** -- Founding entity

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @acstitle.com (from website)
- Confidence: **INFERRED**

### Pain Signals
- **Law firm subsidiary:** Originally established by Millikin & Fitton Law Firm, meaning it may operate as a subsidiary with competing priorities for resources and attention.
- **Long-tenured staff:** "Over half their staff has 20+ years of experience" = deep institutional knowledge but also potential resistance to change and retirement risk.
- **6-county coverage:** Serving 6 Ohio counties from a single Hamilton, OH office = geographic coordination challenges.
- **30-year-old firm:** Established 1995 -- legacy processes likely.

### Tech Stack
- Not disclosed.

### Why Ops for Shops
ACS Title has a classic succession risk: over half the staff has 20+ years of experience, meaning a wave of retirements could hit within the next 5-10 years. Documenting institutional knowledge into repeatable processes and training systems is urgent. The 6-county coverage area from a single office also creates logistical coordination challenges that benefit from systematized workflows.

## PROSPECT 15: Pillar Valuation Group, Inc.

### Priority: 1-HIGH

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Pillar Valuation Group, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.pillarvg.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 871-4467
- **Location:** 3322 Erie Avenue, Suite 200, Cincinnati, OH 45208; also 9403 Kenwood Rd, Suite C109, Cincinnati, OH 45242
- **Founded:** 2007
- **Employees:** ~9 (confirmed from multiple sources)
- **Principal:** Bradley W. Plummer, MAI
- **BBB:** Accredited (bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/real-estate-appraiser/pillar-valuation-group-inc-0292-90013579)
- **Licenses:** 12 states; work in 43 states

### Services
Commercial real property valuation and consulting. Retail complexes, office/industrial facilities, multi-family, residential subdivisions, special uses. Full-service appraisal consulting firm.

### Key People
- **Bradley W. Plummer** -- Principal/MAI (30+ years commercial appraisal experience)
- **Doug [Last Name TBD]** -- Handles hiring (Pillarcareers@pillarvg.com)

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @pillarvg.com
- Hiring email: Pillarcareers@pillarvg.com
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- try bplummer@pillarvg.com or brad@pillarvg.com

### Pain Signals
- **ACTIVELY HIRING:** Job posting for "Staff Certified General Commercial Appraiser (or close to cert)" on Appraisal Institute career center. Requirements: 5+ years experience, Ohio certification, report writing skills.
- **9 employees, 12-state licensing, 43-state work:** A 9-person firm operating across 43 states is stretched incredibly thin.
- **Active hiring = growth pain:** If they can't fill this role, existing staff absorbs the workload.
- **Report-intensive work:** Commercial appraisals require detailed written reports -- document management, quality control, and consistent formatting across a small team are operational challenges.

### Tech Stack
- Not disclosed. Commercial appraisal firms typically use Argus Enterprise, CoStar, TOTAL by a la mode, or proprietary Excel models. Report production likely involves Microsoft Word/Excel.

### Why Ops for Shops
Pillar Valuation Group is actively hiring because they can't keep up with demand. A 9-person firm doing commercial appraisals across 43 states needs extremely tight operational processes -- report quality control, client communication, scheduling, travel coordination, state licensing compliance, and deadline management. Brad Plummer's 30+ years of experience means enormous institutional knowledge that needs to be systematized. The active job posting is a clear signal that they need help -- if they can't hire fast enough, they need to work smarter with the team they have.

## PROSPECT 16: Douglas & Meyer Appraisal Services, Inc.

### Priority: 2-MED

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Douglas & Meyer Appraisal Services, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.dmappraisal.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 528-1024
- **Location:** 463 Ohio Pike, Suite 103, Cincinnati, OH 45255
- **Founded:** March 1, 1994 (incorporated 10/23/1995)
- **Employees:** 6-10
- **President:** Jim Douglas
- **BBB:** Accredited (bbb.org/us/oh/anderson/profile/real-estate-appraiser/douglas-meyer-appraisal-services-inc-0292-1190637)

### Services
Residential real estate appraisals. Also connected to Huff, Meyer and Douglas Appraisals LLC (Fort Mitchell, KY office at hmdappraisal.com).

### Key People
- **Jim Douglas** -- President
- **Bill Douglas** -- Staff appraiser
- **Ryan Mosely** -- Staff appraiser
- **Curtis Whitt** -- Staff appraiser
- **Katy Wuest** -- Connected appraiser (may be at related Wuest & Associates firm)

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @dmappraisal.com (inferred)
- Confidence: **INFERRED** -- try jdouglas@dmappraisal.com

### Pain Signals
- **Multi-entity complexity:** Douglas & Meyer Appraisal Services AND Huff, Meyer and Douglas Appraisals LLC (KY) -- two related entities creates accounting, scheduling, and compliance complexity.
- **30-year-old firm:** Established 1994. Likely accumulated manual processes.
- **Family business:** Bill Douglas and Jim Douglas (likely father/son or brothers) = succession dynamics.

### Tech Stack
- Not disclosed. Residential appraisal firms typically use TOTAL by a la mode, ACI Sky, or similar appraisal software. Report delivery likely via PDF.

### Why Ops for Shops
Douglas & Meyer is a 30-year-old family appraisal firm with 6-10 employees and a related Kentucky entity. The multi-entity structure creates operational overhead that could be streamlined. Jim Douglas is likely thinking about the next chapter -- whether that's growth, succession, or sale -- and all three require documented, transferable processes. The appraisal industry is being disrupted by technology (desktop appraisals, AVMs), making operational efficiency critical for survival.

## PROSPECT 17: Wuest & Associates

### Priority: 3-LOW

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Wuest & Associates
- **Website:** https://www.wuestappraisals.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 459-9434
- **Location:** 3532 Irwin Simpson Rd, Mason, OH 45040
- **Founded:** 1991
- **Employees:** ~4
- **Owner:** David E. Wuest

### Services
Residential and commercial Ohio real estate property appraisals. FHA-approved.

### Key People
- **David E. Wuest** -- Owner
- **Katy Wuest** -- Appraiser (LinkedIn)

### Pain Signals
- Small firm (4 employees) may be below target threshold.
- 35-year-old firm with family staff suggests possible succession planning needs.

### Why Ops for Shops
Rated 3-LOW due to small size (~4 employees, below the 5-employee minimum target). Include only if roster needs padding. Family business succession dynamics are the primary pain point.

## PROSPECT 18: 1st Inspection Services (Cincinnati)

### Priority: 2-MED

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** 1st Inspection Services, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.1stinspections.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 943-3400
- **Location:** 5720 Gateway Ste 104, Mason, OH 45040 (HQ); also 2692 Madison Rd, Ste 385, Cincinnati, OH 45208
- **Founded:** Not confirmed; national franchise model
- **Employees:** Not disclosed (multi-inspector firm operating in OH, KY, NJ, GA)
- **Owner:** Richard McKenzie (Cincinnati franchise/location)
- **BBB:** Accredited (bbb.org/us/oh/cincinnati/profile/home-inspection/1st-inspection-services-0292-90000744)

### Services
Residential, commercial, multi-family inspections. Termite, well, septic testing. Radon, mold testing. Sewer scopes.

### Key People
- **Richard McKenzie** -- Owner & Senior Inspector. LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/richard-mckenzie-a23b5119/

### Email Pattern
- Domain: Not confirmed. Try info@1stinspections.com or richard@1stinspections.com
- Confidence: **GENERIC**

### Pain Signals
- **Angi reviews (mixed):** Customers reported inspectors missing water damage, leaks, and providing insufficient termite inspections -- quality control issues.
- **Multi-state operation:** Operating in OH, KY, NJ, and GA from a Cincinnati base = remote management and quality assurance challenges.
- **Multi-inspector model:** Scaling beyond the owner-inspector requires training, quality standards, and scheduling systems.
- **National franchise branding:** Described as a "leading national real estate inspection franchise" -- may have franchise operational constraints.

### Tech Stack
- Not disclosed. Home inspection firms typically use Spectora, HomeGauge, or similar inspection report software.

### Why Ops for Shops
1st Inspection Services operates across 4 states with multiple inspectors, creating quality control and scheduling challenges. The mixed Angi reviews about missed issues suggest inconsistent inspection quality -- a direct result of inadequate training systems and quality checklists. Richard McKenzie can't personally oversee every inspection, so documented processes and quality standards become critical. Note: May be a franchise, which could limit engagement scope.

## PROSPECT 19: Good Eye Home Inspections

### Priority: 2-MED

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Good Eye Home Inspections, Sewer Scopes & Mold Testing
- **Website:** https://goodeyeinspections.com/ and https://www.bestcincinnatihomeinspector.com/
- **Phone:** Not confirmed from search results
- **Location:** Milford, OH 45150 (Cincinnati metro)
- **Founded:** ~2014 (celebrated 11 years in business in July 2025)
- **Employees:** Not confirmed (Todd Engle is lead inspector; likely has additional inspectors given 20,000+ homes completed)
- **Owner:** Todd Engle, Certified Master Inspector (CMI)
- **BBB:** Accredited (bbb.org/us/oh/milford/profile/home-inspection/good-eye-inspections-0292-90016820)

### Services
Home inspections, sewer scopes, mold testing. Has completed 20,000+ homes. 700+ Google and Facebook reviews.

### Key People
- **Todd Engle** -- Owner & Lead Inspector. CMI designation. Purchased/renovated 25 homes personally. 12,000+ real estate transactions.

### Email Pattern
- Domain: @goodeyeinspections.com or via Spectora booking
- Confidence: **INFERRED**

### Pain Signals
- **Volume growth:** 20,000+ homes inspected and 700+ reviews suggest significant volume that has outgrown a sole-proprietor model.
- **Multiple service lines:** Home inspections + sewer scopes + mold testing = scheduling complexity across different service types.
- **Multiple web presences:** Operating goodeyeinspections.com AND bestcincinnatihomeinspector.com AND cincinnatiohiomold.com = brand fragmentation and content management overhead.
- **Spectora platform:** Uses Spectora for inspection booking/reporting, but multiple websites suggest disconnected marketing systems.

### Tech Stack
- **Spectora** (inspection report and booking software -- confirmed from app.spectora.com listing)
- Multiple WordPress sites

### Why Ops for Shops
Good Eye has grown from a solo operation to a high-volume inspection business (20,000+ homes) with three distinct websites and multiple service lines. Todd Engle is the classic "Reluctant Operator" -- a master inspector who now has to manage a business. The brand fragmentation across three websites, plus scheduling across inspections/sewer scopes/mold testing, creates operational complexity. If Todd has additional inspectors (likely given the volume), quality control and training documentation become critical.

## PROSPECT 20: TREO Realtors (ALREADY IN DATABASE -- SUPPLEMENTAL INTEL)

**Note: TREO Realtors is already in the prospect database. Adding supplemental research here.**

### Updated Intelligence
- **Employees:** ~26 employees, $5.2M revenue (confirmed from search)
- **Back-office team:** Supported by "a team of talented marketers, coordinators & customer service specialists" -- admin team is "hand-selected, expertly trained"
- **Brett Keppler** grew team from 7 to 20 people, became 2nd largest real estate team in Ohio (500+ homes sold in 2013)
- **Property management arm:** TREO Rentals (treorealtors.com/rentals) = additional operational complexity
- **Brett is a proptech founder** (built Nekst task management SaaS) -- uniquely tech-aware but may see Ops for Shops as competitive rather than complementary

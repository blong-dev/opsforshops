## PROSPECT 1: Deimling/jeliho Plastics
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Deimling/jeliho Plastics Inc.
- **Website:** https://deimling-jeliho.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 752-6653
- **Email:** jnewberry@deimling-jeliho.com (INFERRED -- email pattern is firstname+lastname@deimling-jeliho.com per RocketReach; ZoomInfo confirms j***@deimling-jeliho.com)
- **Location:** 4010 Bach Buxton Rd, Amelia, OH 45102
- **Founded:** 1976 (50 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~50 (ZoomInfo)
- **Revenue:** ~$23M annually (ZoomInfo estimate)
- **Services:** Custom thermoplastic injection molding, contract manufacturing, mold making, hot stamping, spin welding, plastic machining, assembly. 27 presses ranging 15-550 tons.
- **Industries Served:** Automotive, gas pump components, industrial OEM

### Key People
- **John Newberry** -- CEO/COO. Primary decision-maker.
- No office manager or plant manager publicly identified.

### Pain Signals

**Employee Retention & Management Issues (Indeed Reviews):**
- "The reason why Deimling Jeliho Plastics can't keep some of their good employees is due to supervisors and lead operators" -- temps who don't conform "get treated differently than everyone else." (Source: Indeed employee review)
- "Lots of tattling going on. Can't trust everybody." (Source: Indeed employee review)
- Temporary employees are "scared to report issues that occur during their shifts because they fear being let go." (Source: Indeed employee review)
- Fast-paced production environment with high turnover signals -- a warehouse manager position was posted on Snagajob, suggesting ongoing staffing needs.

**Operational Complexity Signal:**
- 27 injection presses across multiple tonnage ranges + secondary operations (hot stamping, spin welding, machining, assembly) = complex job scheduling and production tracking requirements. A shop this size with this many concurrent operations and a temp workforce retention problem is likely managing production with spreadsheets or a legacy system.

### Tech Stack
- Website appears to be a basic WordPress or static site
- No ERP or production software publicly visible
- Manufacturing at this scale likely uses some form of job tracking, but the employee reviews suggest disorganized management -- consistent with manual or fragmented systems

### Why Ops for Shops
Deimling/jeliho is the ideal size (50 employees, $23M revenue) with real operational pain. The Indeed reviews paint a picture of supervisory dysfunction and temp workforce churn -- classic symptoms of a shop that has outgrown its management systems. With 27 presses and multiple secondary operations, they need structured job scheduling, production tracking, and workforce management. The CEO/COO wears both hats, suggesting he is operationally stretched.

## PROSPECT 2: Art Woodworking & Manufacturing Company
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Art Woodworking & Manufacturing Company
- **Website:** https://www.artwoodmfg.net/
- **Phone:** (513) 681-2986; Alt: (513) 374-5537
- **Email:** No email publicly listed on website (GENERIC contact form only). Call to obtain.
- **Location:** 4238 Dane Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45223 (Northside)
- **Founded:** 1920 (106 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~30 (Buzzfile/ZoomInfo)
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available
- **Services:** Custom architectural woodworking, paneling, cabinetry (kitchen, bath, commercial), countertops, columns, trims, desks, elevations. Residential and commercial.
- **BBB Accredited:** Since October 2014

### Key People
- **Ralph Dickman** -- President/Owner. Family business (Dickman family), multi-generational.
- No office manager or production manager publicly identified.

### Pain Signals

**Active Hiring -- Capacity Strain:**
- 25 job postings on Indeed for carpenter and basic carpentry positions. For a 30-person shop, this volume of open positions signals either rapid growth, high turnover, or both. Either way, it means the back office is under pressure managing onboarding, scheduling, and job allocation.

**Customer Reviews -- Positive but Operationally Telling:**
- Customer praised custom French doors work but noted process required close coordination: "gave excellent suggestions regarding wood, design details and hardware." (Source: Angi review) This is a high-touch, custom job shop where every project is unique -- exactly the type of operation that breaks down without proper job tracking and estimating tools.

**106-Year-Old Family Business Signal:**
- A company this old, this size, and still family-run almost certainly has deeply entrenched manual processes. The website is basic (no online quoting, no project portal). The business hours (7:30am-4:30pm M-F) and phone-first contact model suggest traditional operations.

### Tech Stack
- Website: Basic static site (artwoodmfg.net), no CMS features visible
- No ERP, estimating, or project management software publicly visible
- Likely relies on paper job tickets, spreadsheets, and tribal knowledge

### Why Ops for Shops
Art Woodworking is a 106-year-old, 30-person custom woodworking shop actively hiring at scale (25 Indeed postings). That hiring volume relative to company size signals operational growing pains. As a custom job shop doing architectural millwork, every project is unique -- they need estimating, job scheduling, material tracking, and production workflow tools. The family-owned, phone-first culture suggests they are ripe for a technology partner who speaks their language, not enterprise software jargon.

## PROSPECT 3: Queen City Printing
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Queen City Printing
- **Website:** https://queencityprinting.com/ (also http://www.q-c-p.com/)
- **Phone:** (513) 631-5050
- **Email:** info@q-c-p.com (GENERIC -- from website/BBB)
- **Location:** 2834 Highland Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45212 (Norwood area)
- **Founded:** Early 1900s (100+ years in business)
- **Employees:** 1-10 (ZoomInfo estimates as low as 1; likely 5-10 given service breadth)
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available
- **Services:** Offset sheet printing, flexography label printing, digital printing/copying, prepress, post-press mailing services, bindery, delivery. Serves manufacturers, retailers, and corporate clients.
- **BBB Accredited:** Since December 2012

### Key People
- **Ron Busch** -- President (LinkedIn title: Sales Manager). Primary contact.
- **Philip Barefield** -- Cost Accounting Clerk (ZoomInfo). Presence of a dedicated cost accounting role in a shop this small suggests financial/job costing is a significant function.

### Pain Signals

**Small Staff, Wide Service Offering:**
- A shop with potentially fewer than 10 employees offering offset, flexo, digital, prepress, mailing, AND bindery is operationally stretched. Every employee likely wears multiple hats. Job scheduling across offset, flexo, and digital presses requires coordination that is painful without production management software.

**Century-Old Business, Minimal Web Presence:**
- Website is dated (queencityprinting.com). No online ordering, no file upload portal, no job status tracking for customers. For a printing company in 2026, this signals a shop that has not invested in modernizing customer-facing or back-office operations.

**Cost Accounting Clerk on Staff:**
- The fact that a shop this small has a dedicated cost accounting person suggests job costing is manual and labor-intensive -- a direct indicator they would benefit from integrated estimating and job costing tools.

### Tech Stack
- Website: Appears to be a legacy PHP/HTML site
- No prepress workflow, MIS (Management Information System), or web-to-print platform visible
- Likely uses manual estimating and job tracking

### Why Ops for Shops
Queen City Printing is a legacy Cincinnati printer with 100+ years of history but a very small team trying to cover offset, flexo, digital, mailing, and bindery. The presence of a dedicated cost accounting clerk in a sub-10-person shop screams manual job costing pain. They need integrated estimating, production scheduling, and job tracking -- but they are small enough that enterprise print MIS systems would be overkill and too expensive.

## PROSPECT 4: 3D Corrugated Packaging & Fulfillment
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** 3D Corrugated Packaging & Fulfillment
- **Website:** https://www.3dcorrugated.com/
- **Phone:** Not publicly listed (contact form on website)
- **Email:** Contact form only (NO public email found). Use LinkedIn for outreach.
- **Location:** 7820 Reading Road, Cincinnati, OH 45237
- **Founded:** 2012 (originally as evolution of Rigacci Box Company). Under current ownership since March 2025.
- **Employees:** Small (estimated 5-20 based on operation type; ZoomInfo did not provide count)
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available
- **Services:** Custom corrugated boxes, branded packaging, shipping supplies, pick-and-pack fulfillment (3PL), daily UPS/USPS/FedEx pickup.

### Key People
- **Nick Brophy** -- President/CEO (acquired company March 2025). Also runs Incline Enterprises Inc.
- **Thad Airhart** -- Operations Manager
- Previous owners: Marty Boyer and Matt Mauser (acquired Dec 2020, sold 2025); founders Terry and Dan Davis (2012)

### Pain Signals

**Multiple Ownership Changes:**
- Three ownership changes in 13 years (Davis brothers 2012 -> Boyer/Mauser 2020 -> Brophy 2025). Each transition likely brought new processes, new systems (or no systems), and lost institutional knowledge. Nick Brophy is less than a year into ownership -- he is in the "figuring out what I've got" phase, which is exactly when an ops consultant adds the most value.

**Dual Business Model Complexity:**
- Running both custom packaging manufacturing AND 3PL fulfillment from the same facility requires distinct operational workflows -- production scheduling for box manufacturing vs. pick/pack/ship for fulfillment. Managing both without integrated systems creates chaos.

**No Public Contact Info:**
- No phone number or email on the website (contact form only) signals either a very lean operation or a company still getting its digital house in order under new ownership.

### Tech Stack
- Website: Shopify-based (3dcorrugated.com uses Shopify for their e-commerce/supplies storefront)
- Fulfillment likely uses some WMS or manual tracking
- No ERP or production management software visible

### Why Ops for Shops
3D Corrugated is a newly acquired packaging/fulfillment operation where the new owner (Nick Brophy, since March 2025) is still establishing his operational foundation. The dual business model (custom packaging + 3PL fulfillment) creates scheduling complexity, and three ownership changes in 13 years means there is almost certainly no standardized process documentation. This is a "greenfield" ops opportunity -- help the new owner build it right from the start.

## PROSPECT 5: Kahny Printing
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Kahny Printing Inc. (dba Kahny Inc.)
- **Website:** https://www.kahny.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 251-2911
- **Email:** info@kahny.com (CONFIRMED -- listed on website contact page)
- **Location:** 4766 River Road, Cincinnati, OH 45233
- **Founded:** 1957 (69 years in business)
- **Employees:** Estimated 10-25 (15,000 sq ft facility; family-owned with named leadership team)
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available
- **Services:** Offset printing, digital printing, graphic design, promotional products, mailing services, large format printing. Also operates an ESP (promotional products) web store.

### Key People
- **John Kahny** -- Owner (3rd generation, founded by Jack and Claire Kahny in 1957)
- **Carol Sohmer** -- Chairman
- **Howard Zoellner** -- Vice President

### Pain Signals

**Multi-Channel Complexity for a Small Shop:**
- Kahny runs both traditional print production AND a promotional products e-commerce store (kahny.espwebsite.com on the ESP platform). Managing two distinct order pipelines -- custom print jobs requiring estimating/prepress/production vs. promotional product sourcing/drop-shipping -- with a small team is operationally complex.

**69-Year Family Business, Traditional Operations:**
- Founded in a 1-car garage in 1957, now in a 15,000 sq ft facility. The growth trajectory over decades suggests incremental process layering rather than systematic operational design. Website lists fax number (513-251-7004) -- a fax number in 2026 is a strong signal of legacy processes.

**No Digital Ordering or Job Status:**
- Main website (kahny.com) has no online file upload, no job status portal, no web-to-print. Customers likely call or email to place orders, get proofs via email, and track jobs by calling in. This is operationally expensive for both Kahny and their customers.

### Tech Stack
- Website: Static HTML site (kahny.com)
- Promotional products: ESP Web (industry standard promo platform)
- No print MIS, prepress workflow, or web-to-print platform visible
- Still lists fax number -- legacy infrastructure

### Why Ops for Shops
Kahny is a 69-year-old family printer running dual business lines (custom print + promotional products) from separate platforms with no integrated workflow. The fax-number-on-the-website signal, combined with no digital ordering capability, suggests deeply manual quoting, ordering, and job tracking processes. They are the archetype of a shop that has grown over decades by adding services without modernizing the operational backbone.

## PROSPECT 6: A. Flottemesch + Son
**Priority: 3-LOW**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** A. Flottemesch & Son Inc.
- **Website:** http://www.aflottemesch.com/
- **Phone:** (513) 561-1212
- **Email:** aflottemesch@aol.com (CONFIRMED -- listed on website contact page)
- **Location:** 8201 Camargo Rd, Cincinnati (Madeira), OH 45243
- **Founded:** 1946 in Cincinnati (family craft tradition from 1928 in Germany). 80 years in business.
- **Employees:** Very small -- currently described as "a father and son operation" (Jim Flottemesch Sr. and Jim Flottemesch Jr.). Likely 2-8 total employees.
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available
- **Services:** Custom cabinetry (kitchen, bath, bar, library), architectural millwork, handcrafted cabinets for residential and commercial buildings.
- **BBB Profile:** Listed but not accredited.

### Key People
- **Jim Flottemesch Sr.** -- Owner/Operator (3rd generation)
- **Jim Flottemesch Jr.** -- Owner/Operator (4th generation)

### Pain Signals

**AOL Email Address:**
- aflottemesch@aol.com as the business contact email in 2026 is a significant technology gap signal. This is a shop that has not modernized even basic business communications infrastructure.

**HTTP-Only Website:**
- Website runs on http:// (not https://), indicating no SSL certificate -- another indicator of minimal technology investment.

**Very Small / Possibly Below Employee Threshold:**
- Described as a "father and son operation," which may put them below the 5-employee minimum qualification. However, a custom cabinet shop doing both residential and commercial work likely has at least a few additional craftsmen.

**Minimal Online Presence:**
- No reviews on Manta, limited Yelp presence, no Indeed job postings. Very low digital footprint for a company with 80 years of history. This could mean they rely entirely on referrals and reputation -- or that the business is winding down.

### Tech Stack
- Website: Basic static HTML (aflottemesch.com), HTTP-only, no CMS
- Email: AOL (aflottemesch@aol.com)
- No business software of any kind publicly visible
- Likely all-manual: paper estimates, handwritten job notes, phone scheduling

### Why Ops for Shops
Flottemesch is the definition of a traditional craftsman shop that has never modernized. The AOL email and HTTP website tell the story immediately. If they have enough employees (5+), they could benefit enormously from basic job tracking, estimating, and customer management tools. However, their very small size and possible resistance to technology change make them a longer sales cycle. Lower priority but worth a discovery call to assess actual team size and appetite for change.

# Ops for Shops -- Cincinnati-Area Supplier & Distributor Prospect Dossiers

**Research Date:** February 11, 2026
**Target Segment:** Suppliers, Distributors, and Wholesalers (5-50 employees) in the Cincinnati tri-state area
**Target Buyer Personas:**
- "The Backbone" = Office manager who manages orders, invoicing, inventory tracking
- "The Reluctant Operator" = Owner who built business on relationships but now drowning in logistics and data

## PROSPECT 1: Keidel Supply Co., Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Keidel Supply Co., Inc. (now part of Winsupply family as of Oct 2023)
- **Website:** https://keidel.com/
- **Location:** 3480 Stathem Ave & 1150 Tennessee Ave, Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded:** 1911 (113 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~48
- **Revenue:** ~$22.9M
- **Industry:** Plumbing fixtures, cabinetry, lighting, appliances, PVF distribution

### Key People
- **Mike Barton** -- President & CEO (since 2009)
- **John Robinson** -- Executive Vice President & Partner (since 2010)

### Tech Stack Clues
- Acquired by Winsupply (Oct 2023), meaning they are likely in the middle of a systems integration/migration -- a painful transition period where old workflows break and new ones haven't been established
- No public evidence of modern ERP; the acquisition itself signals legacy systems that may need to be reconciled with Winsupply's platform
- Multiple warehouse locations with deliveries and showrooms -- high coordination complexity

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- Indeed employee review: **"Products are getting lost by warehouse. Deliveries are constantly wrong."** -- This is a textbook inventory management and order fulfillment breakdown
- Indeed employee review: **"Very high turnover rate"** with **"management is a nightmare"** and **"horrible communication, lazy entitled coworkers, no professionalism"**
- Indeed employee review: **"Awful pay, constant turnover, and non-existent raises"**
- Indeed Cincinnati location rating: **2.5 out of 5 stars**
- Glassdoor review titled: **"Not bad"** -- damning with faint praise

### Why They're a Good Prospect
This is a 113-year-old company in the middle of an acquisition integration with Winsupply. Employees are explicitly calling out that products get lost in the warehouse and deliveries are constantly wrong -- these are screaming indicators of disconnected inventory systems, poor order tracking, and manual processes that break under volume. The high turnover suggests that the operational chaos makes the work frustrating, compounding the problem as institutional knowledge walks out the door. The post-acquisition period is a prime window because they need to reconcile legacy systems but may lack the internal capability to do it well. The Backbone here (whoever is managing orders between showrooms and warehouses) is drowning.

## PROSPECT 2: Phillips Supply Company
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Phillips Supply Company, Inc.
- **Website:** https://phillipssupply.com/
- **Location:** Cincinnati, OH 45214 (also serves Portsmouth and Charleston markets)
- **Founded:** 1947 (79 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~55 at HQ, ~75 total
- **Revenue:** ~$20.4M
- **Industry:** Janitorial and sanitary products distribution

### Key People
- **Pamela Phillips Rossmann** -- President/Owner (since 1999, in business 50+ years). Third-generation family leadership. One of the largest family/woman-owned businesses in the Jan/San distributor industry.
- **Thomas Margraf** -- General Manager and Sales Manager

### Tech Stack Clues
- Government vendor (registered on SAM.gov) -- government contracts require specific compliance and invoicing processes that strain manual systems
- FMCSA registered (USDOT: 351917) -- operates delivery fleet, adding logistics/routing complexity
- No evidence of modern ERP or WMS on their website or in job postings
- Serves building services, healthcare, education, government, industrial sectors -- each with different ordering patterns and compliance needs

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- Indeed employee review: **"Not a very positive structured work place"** with **"poor management"** and **"little room for advancement and low end salaries"**
- Indeed employee review: **"Poor management... expect raises? Don't. Warehouse is small and cramped, an accident waiting to happen. They preach safety but when you tell them about a concern, nothing is done."**
- Indeed employee review: **"Expectations are high"** but **"higher ups do not lead by example"**
- Also positive reviews noting owners are **"absolutely amazing people"** -- suggesting the leadership cares but the operational systems aren't keeping up

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Phillips Supply is a classic Reluctant Operator story. Pamela Rossmann has been in this business for 50+ years and clearly cares deeply about people (the positive reviews confirm this). But the negative reviews paint a picture of a warehouse that's outgrown its processes -- cramped, disorganized, with management that can't keep up. At $20M+ in revenue across multiple markets (healthcare, government, education), they're managing diverse customer needs, compliance requirements, and delivery logistics that almost certainly exceed what spreadsheets and basic accounting software can handle. The gap between "expectations are high" and "higher ups do not lead by example" often means leadership knows what good looks like but doesn't have the systems to execute.

## PROSPECT 3: Blue Ash Industrial Supply
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Blue Ash Industrial Supply, Inc.
- **Website:** https://blueashsupply.com/
- **Location:** 6909 Cornell Rd, Blue Ash (Cincinnati), OH 45242
- **Founded:** 1984 (42 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~81
- **Revenue:** ~$14.2M
- **Industry:** Industrial distribution -- cutting tools, abrasives, metalworking fluids, MRO/safety products

### Key People
- **Robert "Bob" Ochs** -- CEO/President (bob@blueashsupply.com)

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website runs on PHP with Angular frontend, Cloudflare -- suggests a custom-built or semi-custom tech stack, not a modern SaaS-first approach
- 12,000 sq ft warehouse with 10,000+ SKUs -- significant inventory complexity
- Serves manufacturing customers in OH, KY, IN, WV -- multi-state distribution with varied compliance needs
- No evidence of modern ERP or WMS in public materials

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- Indeed employee review: **"The owner walked the floor making sure everyone was in their place and not talking to each other"** -- micromanagement signals lack of trust in systems and processes
- Indeed employee review: **"No room for advancement"** and **"management at BAIS is poor"**
- Customer review: **"Staff was disinterested in smaller customers and nobody asked to help them"** -- suggests the team is overwhelmed or the customer tracking/prioritization systems don't exist
- Job description for warehouse role mentions: **"Processing incoming and outgoing orders with the warehouse manager, pulling and inventorying items that are being received and shipped out"** -- manual picking and inventory processes
- Handshake (recruiting platform) description highlights **"importance of time management, customer interface, as well as the finer points of shipping/receiving"** -- code for "we'll teach you our manual processes"

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Bob Ochs walking the floor to make sure everyone is in their place is the behavior of an owner who doesn't trust that the systems will keep things running without his physical presence. That's a Reluctant Operator who built the business on personal oversight but can't scale it. With 10,000+ SKUs in a 12,000 sq ft warehouse, the inventory complexity is real. The customer complaint about being ignored suggests they lack a CRM or customer prioritization system. The job descriptions reveal manual warehouse processes. This is a company where the owner IS the system -- and that's a ticking time bomb as the business grows.

## PROSPECT 4: Worly Plumbing Supply, Inc.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Worly Plumbing Supply, Inc.
- **Website:** https://thinkworly.com/
- **Location:** 96 Caldwell Dr, Cincinnati, OH (HQ in Columbus; also in Delaware and Chillicothe)
- **Founded:** 1952 (74 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~70
- **Revenue:** ~$24-50M (sources vary)
- **Industry:** Wholesale plumbing, HVAC, and industrial supplies

### Key People
- **Jay Worly** -- President

### Tech Stack Clues
- Multiple showroom locations (Columbus, Cincinnati, Chillicothe, Delaware) -- multi-location inventory synchronization challenge
- Serves homeowners, builders, contractors, hoteliers -- diverse customer base with different ordering patterns
- Luxury bath/kitchen fixtures alongside industrial supplies -- two very different inventory management paradigms in one company
- No evidence of modern ERP in public materials

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- Indeed employee review: **"They play up that family owned schtick but it's just an excuse to underpay you"**
- Indeed employee review: **"Not much room to advance"** and **"the turnover rate is terrible"**
- Indeed employee review: For warehouse/inside work, described as **"easy money"** -- suggesting the work is repetitive/manual, not automated
- Angi rating: 4.0/5

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Worly is a 70-year-old family business juggling luxury showroom sales (high-touch, design-driven) alongside industrial wholesale (volume-driven, price-sensitive) across four locations in Ohio. These are fundamentally different business models sharing the same inventory and back-office systems. The "terrible turnover rate" in a family business suggests the operational burden falls heavily on whoever is left, creating a vicious cycle. The fact that warehouse work is described as "easy money" implies highly manual, repetitive tasks -- exactly the kind of work that automation eliminates. Four locations without modern inventory sync means someone is spending hours reconciling stock levels across sites.

## PROSPECT 5: Allied Supply Company
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Allied Supply Company, Inc.
- **Website:** https://alliedsupply.com/
- **Location:** HQ in Dayton, OH; Cincinnati branch at 3010 Harris Ave, Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded:** 1935 (91 years in business)
- **Employees:** 51-200
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available (est. $15-40M based on 6 locations)
- **Industry:** HVACR wholesale distribution (heating, ventilating, AC, refrigeration, air filtration, building management controls)

### Key People
- **Tom Homan** -- President (third generation of Homan family)
- **Scott Gibbons** -- CFO

### Tech Stack Clues
- Six store locations across Ohio (Dayton, Lima, Mansfield, Toledo, Cincinnati, Columbus) -- significant multi-location coordination challenge
- Over $3M in inventory at the Dayton location alone
- Sells only to contractors and commercial end-users -- B2B ordering and account management complexity
- Building management controls as a product line suggests some technical sophistication, but operational tech is unknown

### Pain Signals
- Glassdoor has reviews but specific content was behind paywall; 14 employer-related results in Dayton
- A 91-year-old family business with six locations is statistically very likely to be running on a patchwork of systems -- the age of the business predates modern ERP by decades
- B2B-only model means complex pricing tiers, contractor accounts, credit terms, and order histories that strain basic systems

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Allied Supply is a multi-generational HVAC distributor with six locations across Ohio and $3M+ in inventory at a single branch. The B2B-only model means every sale involves account management, credit terms, contractor pricing tiers, and repeat ordering -- all processes that become nightmares without proper systems. The question is whether a third-generation family business has invested in modern operations tech or is running on the same processes grandpa established. The Cincinnati branch is a natural entry point for a local consultancy. The Backbone at each branch location is likely managing orders, deliveries, and inventory with tools that haven't been updated in years.

## PROSPECT 6: J.B. Doppes Sons Lumber Co.
**Priority: 1-HIGH**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** The J.B. Doppes Sons Lumber Company
- **Website:** https://www.doppeslumber.com/
- **Location:** 1001 Dalton Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45203
- **Founded:** 1869 (157 years in business!) -- Incorporated 1904
- **Employees:** ~16
- **Revenue:** ~$2.4-3.9M
- **Industry:** Building materials, lumber, hardware, plumbing, HVAC, tools, paint, pest control, cleaning supplies

### Key People
- **Edward Ruprecht** -- President (fourth-generation family)

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website (doppeslumber.com) is a simple informational site with no e-commerce functionality
- A second domain (doppeslumber.net) exists as a separate construction supply catalog site -- two disconnected web presences for the same business
- No online ordering capability visible
- Delivery within 20 miles suggests local fleet management without routing software
- Extremely broad product range (lumber, plumbing, HVAC, hardware, paint, pest control, cleaning) in a single location -- massive SKU diversity for a 16-person operation

### Pain Signals
- No BBB accreditation and "insufficient information to issue a rating" despite 157 years in business -- suggests minimal digital presence/modernization
- Two separate websites for the same business (doppeslumber.com and doppeslumber.net) -- a classic sign of piecemeal tech adoption without a unified strategy
- 16 employees managing a product catalog that spans lumber, plumbing, HVAC, hardware, paint, and more -- the breadth-to-staff ratio is enormous
- Customer reviews are positive (friendly, knowledgeable staff) but focus entirely on in-person experience -- no mention of online ordering, account management, or digital tools

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Doppes is 157 years old with 16 employees managing an impossibly broad product catalog. This is the quintessential Reluctant Operator scenario: a business built entirely on relationships, local knowledge, and personal service -- but with no digital infrastructure to support it. The two separate websites signal someone tried to modernize at some point but the effort fragmented rather than consolidated. With lumber, plumbing, HVAC, hardware, paint, pest control, and cleaning supplies, they're managing thousands of SKUs, likely dozens of suppliers, and local delivery -- almost certainly with pen-and-paper or basic spreadsheet processes. Ed Ruprecht is running a 19th-century business that needs 21st-century operations without losing the personal touch that keeps customers loyal.

## PROSPECT 7: The Johnson Electric Supply Company
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** The Johnson Electric Supply Company
- **Website:** https://www.johnson-electric.com/
- **Location:** Two locations in Greater Cincinnati
- **Founded:** 1907 (119 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~20-40 (estimated based on specialist staff listed)
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available
- **Industry:** Wholesale electrical components and supplies distribution

### Key People
- Third-generation family ownership; fourth generation joining the team
- Three engineers, two EETs, a lighting specialist, and a utility rebate specialist on staff

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Uses Epicor Eclipse ERP** -- this is significant. Job postings mention "learn and utilize ERP system (Epicor Eclipse)." They have made an ERP investment, but Epicor Eclipse is complex and often under-utilized in small distributors
- Two warehouses/counters with $2M+ in inventory
- Offers inventory management programs including on-site cribbing, kitting, and customer part number entry -- sophisticated services that demand reliable systems
- FMCSA registered (USDOT: 1925789) -- operates delivery fleet

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- Indeed employee review: **"The product line has voids and parts inventory issues"** -- even with Epicor Eclipse, inventory accuracy is a problem
- Indeed employee review: **"If planning to move forward in the company this is not the place"** with **"people frequently coming and going"** -- turnover suggests operational friction
- Glassdoor: **"The organization is very siloed, with each department only caring about their own KPIs, not what is best for the overall bottom line"** -- classic symptom of disconnected systems where each department has its own data view

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Johnson Electric is interesting because they've already invested in Epicor Eclipse (a real ERP), but the pain signals show they're not getting full value from it. "Product line has voids and parts inventory issues" in a company that runs Eclipse means the system isn't properly configured, data isn't clean, or processes around the system are broken. The siloed departments complaint is a classic "we have the technology but nobody talks to each other through it" problem. This is a perfect engagement for Ops for Shops: they don't need new software, they need someone to connect what they already have and clean up the data that feeds it. The pitch here isn't "buy new tools" -- it's "let us make the expensive tools you already own actually work."

## PROSPECT 8: Cincinnati Fastener & Industrial Supply
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Cincinnati Fastener & Industrial Supply, Inc. (also operates as Cincinnati Fastener Co.)
- **Website:** https://cincinnatifastener.com/
- **Location:** Cincinnati, OH
- **Founded:** 1971 (55 years in business)
- **Employees:** Estimated 15-30 (sources conflict; LinkedIn says 2-10 but other sources suggest 100+; likely 15-30 at Cincinnati operations)
- **Revenue:** Not reliably established
- **Industry:** Industrial fasteners, assembly components, vendor-managed inventory

### Key People
- **John Huetcher** -- President (second generation; took over from founders John C. and Linda Huetcher in the mid-1990s)
- **Eric Huetcher** -- Co-operator (brother)

### Tech Stack Clues
- Website built on **Squarespace** with **Google Forms** for customer interactions -- indicates a small business that hasn't invested in custom digital infrastructure
- Uses **Microsoft 365** -- standard but generic; no industry-specific tools visible
- Offers Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) services, bulk stocking programs, prepackaging/kitting, and new facility setup -- these services require precise inventory tracking systems
- No evidence of an ERP; the Squarespace + Google Forms + M365 stack suggests they're running lean on technology

### Pain Signals
- The gap between the sophistication of their service offerings (VMI, kitting, custom processing) and the simplicity of their tech stack (Squarespace, Google Forms) is itself a pain signal
- VMI programs require real-time inventory visibility and demand forecasting -- hard to do well with spreadsheets and manual counts
- No public employee reviews found -- a small, tight-knit family business where operational strain may be absorbed by the family rather than visible to outside employees

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Cincinnati Fastener offers sophisticated services (VMI, kitting, custom secondary processing) that demand sophisticated systems -- but their tech stack says Squarespace and Google Forms. This is a company that has grown its service capabilities beyond its operational infrastructure. The Huetcher brothers are likely managing VMI programs, bulk stocking, and custom orders through a combination of spreadsheets, email, and personal knowledge. As they serve more customers with more complex needs, this gap will widen. The pitch is: "Your services are world-class, but your systems are holding you back from scaling them."

## PROSPECT 9: Harris Welding Supplies
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Harris Welding Supplies, Inc.
- **Website:** https://harrisweldingsupplies.com/
- **Location:** 460 Breaden Dr, Monroe, OH 45050 (between Cincinnati and Dayton)
- **Founded:** 1980 (46 years in business)
- **Employees:** 11-50
- **Revenue:** <$5M
- **Industry:** Wholesale welding equipment and supplies, gases

### Key People
- **Todd Hancock** -- Owner

### Tech Stack Clues
- E-commerce site appears to be a basic online catalog
- Distributes both physical products (welders, protective gear, cutting tools) AND gases (which require different handling, compliance, and tracking)
- Gas distribution adds regulatory compliance (DOT, OSHA) and cylinder tracking complexity that most small businesses handle manually
- No evidence of modern inventory management or ERP

### Pain Signals
- BBB listing shows "insufficient information to issue a rating" despite 46 years in business -- minimal digital footprint
- Gas cylinder tracking is a known operational nightmare for small welding distributors -- cylinders are leased/owned assets that must be tracked, returned, inspected, and recertified on complex schedules
- Managing both hard goods (welders, PPE) and gas products in a single operation creates two distinct inventory management paradigms

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Harris Welding is a classic "hidden complexity" business. On the surface, it's a welding supply shop. But gas distribution adds layers of operational complexity that most people don't appreciate: cylinder tracking (who has what cylinder, when is it due back, when does it need recertification), DOT compliance, route planning for gas deliveries, and hazmat documentation. These are processes that small welding distributors typically manage with clipboards and spreadsheets. Todd Hancock has been at this for 46 years and has built the business on personal relationships with welders and fabrication shops. But as compliance requirements tighten and customers expect better service, the manual approach becomes unsustainable. The Reluctant Operator persona fits perfectly.

## PROSPECT 10: Wiseway Supply
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Wiseway Supply (originally founded as a family business)
- **Website:** https://www.wisewaysupply.com/
- **Location:** 11 locations including Greater Cincinnati, distribution center in Cincinnati; HQ in Florence, KY
- **Founded:** 1972 (54 years in business)
- **Employees:** 51-200
- **Revenue:** ~$43.7M
- **Industry:** Electrical, plumbing, and lighting supply distribution

### Key People
- **John Cain** -- CEO Emeritus & Strategic Advisor (founded by his parents, "Biz" and Jackie Cain)
- **Phyllis Yeager** -- VP, Human Resources
- **Marianne Brummett** -- Chief Operating Officer
- **Troy Smith** -- General Manager
- **David Windhorn** -- Manager, Pricing

### Tech Stack Clues
- 11 locations with 3 showrooms and a distribution center -- massive multi-location synchronization challenge
- Recently acquired Stearns Supply (Oct 2023) to expand into Indiana -- post-acquisition integration adds complexity
- Dedicated Pricing Manager suggests complex pricing structures that need active management
- Having a dedicated COO (Marianne Brummett) suggests operational complexity is recognized at the leadership level

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- Indeed employee review: Company **"constantly changes the punch system"** -- technology churn suggests they're searching for solutions but not finding stable ones
- Indeed employee review: Store and warehouse is **"incredibly disorganized due to the intentional lack of staff"** -- understaffing + disorganization = processes depend on too few people
- Glassdoor: **"Communication/organization issues that can sometimes be frustrating"**

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Wiseway is at an inflection point. They've grown to 11 locations with a recent acquisition, they have a dedicated COO and Pricing Manager, but employees are complaining about constant system changes and warehouse disorganization. The "constantly changes the punch system" comment reveals a company that keeps trying new technology but can't get it to stick -- likely because they're addressing symptoms (timekeeping) rather than root causes (disconnected operational systems). At $43.7M in revenue with 11 locations, they may be on the upper end of Ops for Shops' target size, but the operational pain is real and the COO (Marianne Brummett) is the exact buyer persona to approach. NOTE: Their size (51-200 employees) may exceed the target range. Consider as a stretch prospect.

## PROSPECT 11: Murphy Supply Company
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Murphy Supply Company
- **Website:** https://murphy-supply.com/
- **Location:** 4911 Muhlhauser Rd, Cincinnati, OH 45011
- **Founded:** 1950 (76 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~5
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available (small)
- **Industry:** Janitorial supplies distribution

### Key People
- **James M. Murphy** -- Treasurer (j.murphy@murphy-supply.com)
- **Gloria B. Murphy** -- Family member/operator
- **Jeanne Murphy** -- Family member/operator
- **Brant Alan Barnes** -- Staff
- **Eric Seizer** -- Staff

### Tech Stack Clues
- 25,000 sq ft warehouse and showroom -- large facility for a 5-person team
- Full product catalog online at catalog.murphy-supply.com (appears to be a third-party catalog platform, not custom)
- Carries name brands (Nobles, Sanitaire, Hoover, Rubbermaid) -- manufacturer relationships and ordering complexity
- Third-generation family business -- processes likely inherited rather than designed

### Pain Signals (Direct Quotes)
- Indeed employee review: **"The owner is so kind & caring. He's very flexible with life, & always willing to talk in depth about something. He doesn't make you feel stupid for asking questions & he genuinely cares about your well being."** -- This is actually a pain signal in disguise. A beloved owner managing everything personally at a 76-year-old business with 5 employees is the ultimate Reluctant Operator.

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Murphy Supply is a tiny team (5 people) running a 25,000 sq ft warehouse that's been in the family for three generations. James Murphy is clearly loved by his employees, but at 76 years old, this business is running on James's personal knowledge and relationships. With 5 people managing a full janitorial supply catalog, every person is wearing multiple hats -- ordering, receiving, stocking, selling, delivering, invoicing. The processes are almost certainly in peoples' heads, not in systems. This is a succession planning time bomb: when James steps back, how does the business continue without his institutional knowledge? Ops for Shops can help document processes, connect systems, and create operational resilience that lets the business outlive any single person.

## PROSPECT 12: Queen City Restaurant Supply (QCRS)
**Priority: 2-MED**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Queen City Restaurant Supply LLC (QCRS)
- **Website:** https://queencityrestaurantsupply.com/
- **Location:** 3580 Spring Grove Ave, Cincinnati, OH 45223 (Camp Washington)
- **Founded:** 2015 (11 years in business)
- **Employees:** Estimated 5-15
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available
- **Industry:** Restaurant equipment and supply distribution

### Key People
- Ownership not publicly identified by name
- Team collectively has **125+ years of food service industry experience**

### Tech Stack Clues
- **Runs a Shopify online store** (queencityrestaurantsupply.myshopify.com) alongside their main WordPress website -- two disconnected platforms for web presence and e-commerce
- 17,500 sq ft of inventory -- substantial for a relatively young, small company
- Sells both new and used/closeout equipment -- two different inventory value tracking paradigms
- Offers restaurant layout design services alongside equipment sales -- service + product business model adds complexity
- FMCSA registered (USDOT: 3949921) -- operates delivery fleet

### Pain Signals
- Shopify store + separate WordPress website = classic disconnected systems. Orders from Shopify likely don't auto-sync with their inventory or accounting
- Selling new AND used/closeout equipment means constantly changing inventory values, different margin structures, and complex pricing -- hard to manage in basic tools
- The 125 years of combined experience statement suggests an older team that may be comfortable with legacy processes
- Job posting for part-time showroom sales associate suggests they're growing but hiring at the entry level -- operations burden likely falls on a small core team
- Young company (2015) that grew fast (17,500 sq ft, delivery fleet) -- classic "outgrew the spreadsheet" trajectory

### Why They're a Good Prospect
QCRS is a newer company that's grown quickly into a substantial operation (17,500 sq ft, delivery fleet, Shopify store). The disconnected Shopify + WordPress setup is a visible symptom of cobbled-together systems. They're managing new equipment, used equipment (variable pricing), restaurant design services, walk-in showroom sales, online sales, and delivery -- all likely without integrated systems. The experienced team knows the industry but probably built processes on the fly as the business grew. Now they need to professionalize operations without slowing down. The owner is likely a Reluctant Operator who started with industry expertise and hustle but is now managing logistics and data instead of doing what they love -- helping restaurants succeed.

## PROSPECT 13: Alcor Supply Company
**Priority: 3-LOW**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Alcor Supply Company
- **Website:** https://www.alcorsupply.com/
- **Location:** 110 E Linden Ave, Miamisburg, OH 45342 (Dayton metro, serves Cincinnati)
- **Founded:** 1970 (56 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~20-49
- **Revenue:** Estimated $5-50M (sources vary widely)
- **Industry:** Janitorial and restaurant supply distribution

### Key People
- **Joe Harrison** -- President
- Women and veteran-owned business

### Tech Stack Clues
- Online catalog at alcorsupply.com powered by what appears to be a third-party catalog platform
- Represents 600 different manufacturers -- managing that many vendor relationships requires serious procurement and PO management
- Separate shipping/receiving facility at 236 S 2nd St, Miamisburg -- split operations across two addresses
- Products span janitorial supplies, foam/plastic disposables, foodservice equipment, and textiles -- wide catalog diversity

### Pain Signals
- Indeed employee review mentions **"poor management and worse equipment to work with"** -- operational infrastructure hasn't kept up
- A+ BBB rating but minimal online review presence -- traditional business that hasn't embraced digital
- 600 manufacturer relationships managed by a 20-49 person team -- the procurement and vendor management complexity is staggering for a company this size
- Split facilities (showroom vs. shipping/receiving) add coordination overhead

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Alcor manages relationships with 600 manufacturers from a 20-49 person team split across two facilities. The sheer volume of vendor relationships -- each with their own ordering portals, pricing structures, lead times, and minimum quantities -- is an operational nightmare without modern procurement tools. The "worse equipment to work with" review suggests capital hasn't been invested in operational infrastructure. As a women and veteran-owned business, they may qualify for grants or programs that could offset consultancy costs. Joe Harrison as president of a 56-year-old family business fits the Reluctant Operator profile. Note: Located in Dayton/Miamisburg, so slightly outside core Cincinnati geography.

## PROSPECT 14: Sunset Janitorial Supply
**Priority: 3-LOW**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Sunset Janitorial Supply, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.sunsetjanitorialsupply.com/
- **Location:** Cincinnati, OH 45214
- **Founded:** 1989 (37 years in business)
- **Employees:** ~6-7
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available (small)
- **Industry:** Commercial cleaning products and equipment distribution

### Key People
- **Amy Hoffman** -- Owner (per BBB)
- **Jerry Diers** -- Owner (per LinkedIn)
- **Joe Ruhe** -- Sales Representative

### Tech Stack Clues
- Very basic website -- minimal digital infrastructure
- Offers machine repair services alongside product distribution -- additional service line adds operational complexity
- Free next-day delivery for in-stock items -- delivery logistics for a 6-person team
- BBB Accredited since 10/17/2022 -- recent formalization suggests the business is trying to professionalize

### Pain Signals
- Two people listed as "owner" on different platforms (Amy Hoffman on BBB, Jerry Diers on LinkedIn) -- could indicate a partnership or transition, either of which creates operational complexity
- 6-7 employees managing product distribution, machine repair, and next-day delivery -- extreme multi-tasking
- Recent BBB accreditation (2022) after 33 years in business -- a company that's only now starting to formalize its presence
- Very limited online reviews -- suggests they rely entirely on personal relationships for business

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Sunset Janitorial is a tiny operation where everyone does everything. With 6-7 people handling product sales, machine repair, inventory management, and next-day delivery, there's no room for specialization and no margin for error. The recent BBB accreditation after 33 years suggests the ownership is starting to think about formalizing the business. This is a small but potentially rewarding engagement: the operational improvements would be immediately felt because the team is so small that any efficiency gain multiplies across every person. The dual-owner situation (Amy Hoffman / Jerry Diers) may mean the business is in transition -- another moment when operational clarity becomes critical.

## PROSPECT 15: Cincinnati Piping Supply
**Priority: 3-LOW**

### Company Overview
- **Full Name:** Cincinnati Piping Supply, Inc.
- **Website:** https://www.cincinnatipipingsupply.com/
- **Location:** 5583 Creek Road, Blue Ash, OH 45242
- **Founded:** 1977 (49 years in business)
- **Employees:** Estimated 5-15
- **Revenue:** Not publicly available
- **Industry:** Residential and commercial plumbing supplies

### Key People
- Ownership not publicly identified by name
- Team described as "knowledgeable and experienced" with 40+ years of industry experience

### Tech Stack Clues
- Simple informational website with no e-commerce capability
- Serves residential, commercial, industrial, and mechanical markets -- four distinct customer segments from a single location
- No evidence of online ordering, CRM, or modern inventory management

### Pain Signals
- Birdeye rating: 4.2 stars with only 10 reviews after 49 years -- minimal digital presence
- Customer reviews focus entirely on in-person experience: **"Great bunch of guys, experts in the field"** and **"Very knowledgeable and helpful"** -- relationship-driven business with no digital support
- Serving four distinct markets (residential, commercial, industrial, mechanical) from a single location means managing different pricing tiers, ordering patterns, and customer needs -- complex for a small team without systems

### Why They're a Good Prospect
Cincinnati Piping Supply is a 49-year-old business that operates almost entirely on expertise and relationships. The lack of any digital ordering or CRM capability, combined with serving four distinct market segments, suggests all customer management is in people's heads. This is a succession risk and a scaling constraint. The Backbone in this business -- whoever manages orders, tracks inventory, and handles invoicing -- is almost certainly using manual processes that have worked for decades but won't survive a retirement or a growth spurt.

## INDUSTRY CONTEXT: WHY THIS SEGMENT IS RIPE

The wholesale distribution industry has a well-documented pattern: Nearly **43% of small businesses don't track their inventory or still use manual processes**, resulting in up to **11% of annual revenue lost to inefficiencies**. The typical progression for small distributors:

- **Year 1-3:** QuickBooks handles everything
- **Year 3-5:** Excel spreadsheets appear to track what QuickBooks can't
- **Year 5+:** The business runs on a **"patchwork of disconnected systems held together by manual processes"**

Nearly 70% of small businesses rely on QuickBooks for accounting, but it wasn't built to handle multi-location inventory, complex B2B pricing, or vendor-managed inventory programs.

These Cincinnati-area suppliers and distributors are exactly at this inflection point -- businesses with 40-150+ years of history, built on relationships and personal expertise, now facing operational complexity that exceeds what their founder-era systems can handle.

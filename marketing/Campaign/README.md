# Social Campaign: The Thinker Who Does The Work

*Bluesky + X presence campaign. Built February 2026.*
*Source material: attribution-economics research, DreamTree private docs, OpsForShops avatars.*

## Strategy

### Who You Are Online
A writer and systems thinker walking toward publication. You read primary sources, build things, and run ops for small businesses. The ideas lead. The business proves they're real.

### Pillars & Mix
- **Ideas (50%)** — attribution economics, history, philosophy. Original thinking. Walking toward the paper in public.
- **Small Business / Ops (30%)** — why shops matter, distributed power in practice, friction, observations from the ground. Connects theory to livelihood.
- **Provocations (10%)** — standalone lines. Scroll-stoppers.
- **Personal (10%)** — your voice, observations, the occasional raw moment.

### Platforms
- **Bluesky** — intellectual home. Threads. Economics and history. Decentralization crowd. AT Protocol is directly relevant to your vision.
- **X** — broader reach. Hooks and provocations. Small business angle plays stronger. Hard numbers stop the scroll.

### Cadence
2 posts/day per platform. Cross-post with light adaptation (Bluesky gets slightly longer/more nuanced; X gets punchier hooks).

14 unique posts/week. SocialBee rotates through the category library.

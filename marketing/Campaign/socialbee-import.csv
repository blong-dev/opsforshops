"Something is wrong with how we count. Productivity in the US grew 61.8% since 1979. Wages grew 17.5%. I've been trying to figure out why that gap exists. Not as policy -- as physics. Writing a paper about it.","Ideas"
"The historian Fernand Braudel spent his career distinguishing between the market economy and capitalism. Most people think they're the same thing. They're not. The market economy is where people trade honestly. Capitalism is the layer above -- ""the zone of the anti-market, where the great predators roam and the law of the jungle operates."" Your local shop is market economy. The platform it pays 30% to is the anti-market.","Ideas"
"Every calorie of food you eat traces back to a photon that left the sun eight minutes ago. I don't say that to be poetic. I say it because value creation is physical. It's energy transformation. And until we treat it that way, we'll keep miscounting who actually creates it.","Ideas"
"I've spent the last few years reading Georgescu-Roegen, Coase, Ostrom, Braudel, Akerlof, and Marx (the methodology, not the revolution). Building a thermodynamic framework for why people don't capture the value they create. Not because I'm an academic. Because I got tired of watching it happen.","Ideas"
"Currency doesn't create value. Currency doesn't even measure value. Currency is a standardized claim on future value, used to settle debts and coordinate exchange. It's a settlement mechanism, not a measurement mechanism. We've been confusing the receipt with the thing it records.","Ideas"
"I'm working on a concept called the Individual Loss Function. When you do useful work, you transform energy into something ordered and valuable. That's thermodynamics, not metaphor. The gap between what you create and what you capture is: L = V_created - V_captured. That gap has five sources: physics (unavoidable), friction (coordination costs), extraction (power imbalance), decay (people forget), and threshold failures (you can't coordinate alone). Attribution -- persistent records of who did what -- reduces four of the five.","Ideas"
"The half-life of a verbal ""thank you"" is about 1-3 years. A published paper: 5-15 years. A cryptographic record: 50+ years. At 50 years, the difference in preserved value is 100,000x. Small differences in how well we record contributions compound exponentially. This isn't sentiment. It's math.","Ideas"
"Every major leap in verification technology has enabled a new form of economic coordination: Clay tablets -> temple economies. Coinage -> market economies. Double-entry bookkeeping -> capitalism. Cryptographic attestation -> ? That's not ideology. That's the historical record.","Ideas"
"The Medici Bank operated for 97 years across 8 European cities with about 60 staff. How? Double-entry bookkeeping. Not for ""rational calculation"" -- the evidence shows merchants mostly used it for debt tracking. The mechanism was trust across distance. The accounting didn't cause the empire. It made the empire possible.","Ideas"
"In 1902, Werner Sombart claimed double-entry bookkeeping was essential to the rise of capitalism. A century of debate followed. Yamey said no. De Roover complicated it. Carruthers and Espeland landed on: the rhetoric mattered more than the math. The accounts convinced people the enterprise was legitimate. Trust, not calculation. I think attribution infrastructure plays the same role for whatever comes next.","Ideas"
"Cities that got printing presses in the 1400s grew 60% faster than similar cities that didn't (Dittmar, 2011). The mechanism wasn't literacy. It was standardization -- identical copies, shared references, commercial arithmetics. The first printed math textbooks were designed for business students. Reduce friction, enable coordination, transform the economy. It's the same pattern every time.","Ideas"
"The ILO estimates 16.4 billion hours of unpaid care work happen every day. That's $11 trillion a year in value created. Captured by the people who created it: approximately zero. The mother's contribution was always real. We just stopped pretending only currency makes it count.","Ideas"
"Compounding interest claims future value that doesn't yet exist. Someone else pays. Compounding attribution preserves past value that already exists. Everyone benefits. Both compound exponentially. One extracts. The other conserves.","Ideas"
"Money is Goodhart's Law in action. It started as a measure of value. It became the target. Now people optimize for money rather than value creation. Attribution is an attempt to realign the measure with the thing it's supposed to measure.","Ideas"
"The Dutch East India Company raised 6.5 million guilders from 1,800 investors in 1602. Its accounting was ""remarkably underdeveloped"" for its scale. It operated for nearly 200 years on minimal verification. Then it went bankrupt. You can get far with bad attribution. But not forever.","Ideas"
"People ask if my framework is Marxist. Fair question. What I take from Marx: material conditions constrain what's possible. Tools shape societies. The gap between contribution and capture is real. What I reject: determinism, revolution as necessity, capitalism as inherently evil. Five independent traditions support the same claims without Marx's politics. I use materialist methodology without committing to Marxist politics. I welcome correction.","Ideas"
"Axelrod ran tournament after tournament. Tit-for-tat kept winning. Not because it was clever -- because it was reliable. Cooperate first. Retaliate proportionally. Forgive quickly. The conditions for cooperation: memory, recognition, a shadow of the future, reciprocity. Attribution provides all four.","Ideas"
"Elinor Ostrom won the Nobel for proving communities can self-govern shared resources without privatization or state control. Her design principles include: monitoring, graduated sanctions, proportional equivalence between contribution and benefit. All three require attribution. You can't govern a commons if you can't see who's contributing and who's free-riding.","Ideas"
"Rosalind Franklin's X-ray crystallography was essential to discovering DNA's structure. She wasn't credited. Katherine Johnson calculated orbital trajectories for NASA. She was invisible for decades. Open source maintainers keep critical infrastructure running. Most are unpaid. The pattern: contribution is real. Attribution is fragile. Capture follows attribution.","Ideas"
"Power without wisdom is adolescence. The teenager with car keys. The corporation with compute. The species with the atom. We are living through the adolescence of artificial intelligence -- and perhaps our own. Adolescence is dangerous not because of its energy, but because of its blindness.","Ideas"
"Will attribution infrastructure serve the market economy -- transparent, competitive, fair -- or the anti-market -- opaque, monopolistic, extractive? The technology doesn't decide. We do.","Ideas"
"Eight base capabilities compose every skill a human has: pattern recognition, memory, motor control, attention, language, social modeling, sequencing, emotional regulation. Like quarks composing hadrons. You can't observe them directly. But everything you do is made of them.","Ideas"
"You cannot revolt against an algorithm you don't understand. You cannot debate a neural network that governs credit access, employment visibility, or political discourse. Today's tyranny is informational. Resistance must be epistemic.","Ideas"
"Knowledge should be free to use, but never free of its history. The models did not teach themselves. We taught them. And then we forgot that we had.","Ideas"
"From the sun to your paycheck, value passes through eight stages of transformation. Photosynthesis. Trophic transfer. Agriculture. Metabolism. Technology. Skill. Coordination. Fit. Each stage multiplies. The least efficient stages? Coordination and fit. The ones most improved by attribution.","Ideas"
"Attribution doesn't create value. Attribution lets us observe the value that physics already created. Like the telescope didn't create the stars but let us see them.","Ideas"
"My framework creates receipts, not rewards. Proof of who contributed what -- separate from how they're compensated. You can't fix distribution without fixing measurement first.","Ideas"
"The ILO estimates that 61% of the world's workers -- approximately 2 billion people -- operate in the informal economy. Their contributions are real. Their value creation is physical. Their attribution is approximately zero.","Ideas"
"Current economics skips from physics to settlement. Someone does work, someone gets paid (or doesn't). What's missing: observation (someone sees it happen) and attestation (a record persists). Those two layers are where we lose everything.","Ideas"
"Global ad spend will hit $1.1 trillion this year. How much of that goes to the people whose data built it? The attention economy doesn't create value. It extracts it. And the returns are flattening. Everyone can feel it.","Ideas"
"Before writing, attribution was oral. Unreliable. Decaying. With writing, contributions could persist beyond a single memory. Every advance in recording technology extended attribution's reach. Cryptographic attestation is the next step -- not because it's new, but because it makes attribution durable enough to build an economy on.","Ideas"
"Ronald Coase asked in 1937: if markets are efficient, why do firms exist? His answer: transaction costs. It's cheaper to coordinate inside a firm than to negotiate every exchange on the open market. Attribution reduces transaction costs. If Coase is right, better attribution changes where the boundary between firm and market falls.","Ideas"
"We are the last generation to remember a time before omnipresent intelligence, and the first to raise children who will never know its absence. The hinge of history is now. The story is still being written.","Ideas"
"I run operations for small businesses. I also write about economics. Those aren't two things. Small business is the only layer of capitalism where the market actually works the way the textbook says it does -- transparent, competitive, real. Everything above that is extraction wearing a suit.","SmallBusiness"
"Every small business owner I work with is doing something an economist would call ""reducing local entropy."" They're taking disorder -- unmet needs, scattered resources, confused processes -- and creating order. They don't use those words. They just open the shop.","SmallBusiness"
"When a platform takes 30% from a local shop, that's not a ""fee."" That's extraction. The shop created the value. The platform provided discovery. Discovery is not worth 30% of everything, forever. But without attribution -- without proof of who created what -- the platform sets the price.","SmallBusiness"
"The best operations work is invisible. Nobody notices when the schedule runs clean, when inventory is right, when the handoff between shifts doesn't drop anything. That's the point. You build the system so the humans can focus on being human.","SmallBusiness"
"Small businesses fail because of operations more than ideas. The idea is usually fine. The execution gets killed by friction -- bad systems, lost information, miscommunication, things falling through cracks. Friction is my enemy in theory and in practice.","SmallBusiness"
"I help shops run better. That's not a side hustle while I think big thoughts. That IS the big thought at street level. A local business owner creating value, employing people, serving a community. That's the market economy actually working. My job is to keep friction low so they can keep doing it.","SmallBusiness"
"Distributed power isn't an abstraction. It's the coffee shop that employs four people. The plumber who trains an apprentice. The bakery that sponsors the little league team. Centralization is efficient. Distribution is resilient. I'll take resilient.","SmallBusiness"
"The hardest thing for a small business owner to hear: you are the bottleneck. Not because you're bad at your job. Because you're too good at it. Everything runs through you because nobody else does it as well. That's not a compliment -- it's a trap. The fix isn't working harder. It's building systems that don't need you in the loop for every decision.","SmallBusiness"
"A business that depends on one person's heroic effort is a business that's one bad week from collapse. Systems don't replace people. Systems protect people. They make sure the important stuff happens even when someone's sick, or on vacation, or having a bad day.","SmallBusiness"
"If you bill $200/hour for your expertise and you're spending 10 hours a week on admin, that's $2,000/week in lost revenue. $100K/year. You don't have an admin problem. You have a six-figure leak.","SmallBusiness"
"Every small business I walk into has a graveyard of tools they bought and never implemented. The CRM nobody uses. The project management app with three entries. The automation that runs but nobody checks. The tools aren't the problem. The implementation was.","SmallBusiness"
"""Digital transformation"" is what consultants sell when they don't understand your business well enough to name the actual problem. You don't need transformation. You probably need three things fixed.","SmallBusiness"
"The best ops work comes from referrals. One office manager tells another. One owner mentions you at Rotary. That's not marketing failure. That's how trust works. Trust doesn't scale through ads. It scales through proof.","SmallBusiness"
"When someone local fixes your operations, they're accountable. You see them at the grocery store. Their reputation lives in the same community as yours. That's not quaint. That's a trust architecture that platforms can't replicate.","SmallBusiness"
"I talk to a lot of office managers who are competent but underwater. They know they're good at their job -- the office would collapse without them. But they spend most of their time on tasks that shouldn't require a human. They're not burned out yet. But they can see it from here.","SmallBusiness"
"Your systems should work for you, not the other way around. If you're adapting your workflow to fit your software instead of your software fitting your workflow, something went wrong during setup. That's fixable.","SmallBusiness"
"Bad operations don't show up on the P&L. They show up in the owner's stress level, the staff's frustration, the client who didn't come back, the opportunity that passed because you couldn't move fast enough. The cost is real. It's just invisible.","SmallBusiness"
"Small businesses employ 46% of the US private workforce. They're not the margins of the economy. They are the economy. When a shop runs better, a community runs better.","SmallBusiness"

          <h1 id="article-title">Your Website Isn’t Helping Your Business</h1>
          <p class="lead">Most small business owners have a website because they were told they needed one.</p>

          <article class="flow article-body">
            <p>It looks fine. Maybe even good. It has photos, a logo, a menu or product list, an about page. It exists, it loads, and no one complains about it. From the outside, it feels like that box is checked.</p>
            <p>But if you’re honest, the website isn’t actually helping you run the business.</p>
            <p>In a lot of cases, the website is completely disconnected from everything that matters day to day. It doesn’t know what’s in stock. It doesn’t know what’s sold. It doesn’t know who your customers are or what they’ve bought before. It’s not tied into your POS, your inventory, or your customer data in any meaningful way.</p>
            <p>So it just sits there.</p>
            <p>This usually isn’t because the owner didn’t care or cut corners. It’s because website services are sold as a one-time project, not as part of an operating system. You pay someone to design it, launch it, and move on. Updates cost extra. Changes feel annoying. Over time, the site drifts out of sync with reality.</p>
            <p>Prices change. Inventory changes. Hours change. Promotions come and go. The website doesn’t keep up unless someone manually makes it happen. And most weeks, that someone isn’t you.</p>
            <p>So the site slowly becomes decorative. It looks professional, but it doesn’t do any work. It doesn’t reduce effort. It doesn’t prevent mistakes. It doesn’t save time. It just exists to signal legitimacy.</p>
            <p>That gap between looking good and working well is expensive.</p>
            <p>Customers see outdated information and get frustrated. Staff answer questions the website should already handle. Inventory that could be sold online isn’t visible. Opportunities for follow-up or repeat business disappear because nothing connects back to customer data.</p>
            <p>And because the site technically works, it’s hard to justify fixing it. There’s always something more urgent. The website becomes one more thing that’s “good enough,” even though it quietly creates extra work every day.</p>
            <p>A useful website is not a brochure. It’s part of the business. It reflects what’s actually happening, in real time, and reduces the number of times a human has to step in to correct it.</p>
            <p>When a website isn’t connected to your POS, inventory, or CRM, it can’t do that. It becomes another disconnected system — one more place where reality and representation drift apart.</p>
            <p>This isn’t about aesthetics. Plenty of beautiful websites are operationally useless. What matters is whether the site helps information flow cleanly, or whether it just adds another surface that has to be managed.</p>
            <p>In the next article, we’ll look at what happens when that disconnect extends beyond your website and into Google itself — and why so many good businesses are effectively invisible online.</p>
            <p>If your website looks nice but still creates work, the problem isn’t you. It’s what the site was built to do.</p>
            <p>If this speaks to you, reach out. I’ll roll up my sleeves and share my expertise.</p>

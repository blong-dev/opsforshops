          <h1 id="article-title">If Google Can’t See You, Customers Can’t Either</h1>
          <p class="lead">A lot of small business owners think of Google as a marketing channel. That framing is wrong.</p>

          <article class="flow article-body">
            <p>For most customers, Google is the front door. If it can’t see you clearly, you effectively don’t exist — no matter how good the business is inside.</p>
            <p>The most basic version of this problem is simple: the business isn’t listed properly. Hours are wrong. The address is off. The category doesn’t match what you actually do. Reviews exist, but no one is really managing them. Customers search for you and get partial or outdated information.</p>
            <p>That alone costs business.</p>
            <p>The deeper problem shows up when inventory and offerings aren’t visible. What you actually sell doesn’t appear in search results. Products aren’t indexed. Services aren’t described in a way Google understands. So customers searching for exactly what you offer never see you. They see a bigger business, farther away, with worse service, but better visibility.</p>
            <p>This isn’t a failure of effort. Most owners don’t even know this is happening. They assume that having a website and a business listing is enough. They don’t realize that Google relies on structured, consistent information to understand what a business does and what it has available.</p>
            <p>When your website, POS, and inventory are disconnected, Google gets a broken picture of your business. It can’t tell what’s in stock. It can’t tell what’s current. It can’t confidently surface your business for specific searches. So it doesn’t.</p>
            <p>That’s not marketing. That’s plumbing.</p>
            <p>Local and product visibility aren’t about growth hacks or clever tactics. They’re about making sure the business is legible to the systems customers actually use to decide where to go. When that legibility breaks down, demand quietly leaks away.</p>
            <p>This is especially brutal for small businesses, because the competition isn’t better — it’s just louder. Larger companies invest heavily in making themselves visible, even when the experience is worse. They show up first, so they get the click.</p>
            <p>If Google can’t see you clearly, customers can’t find you. And if customers can’t find you, everything else becomes harder. Revenue feels unpredictable. Slow days feel mysterious. You blame seasonality or luck when the real issue is invisibility.</p>
            <p>This isn’t something you can hustle your way out of. Posting more or trying harder doesn’t fix broken signals. Visibility comes from consistency — from making sure your systems tell the same story everywhere.</p>
            <p>In the next article, we’ll step back and look at the bigger trap behind all of this: why so many “all-in-one” solutions promise to fix these problems and often make them worse.</p>
            <p>If your business is hard to find online, it’s not because it’s unworthy. It’s because the systems around it aren’t speaking clearly.</p>
            <p>If this speaks to you, reach out. I’ll roll up my sleeves and share my expertise.</p>
